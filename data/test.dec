Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Then that's all you had to say.
No.
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
What do you think?
As in...
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
You set me up.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
And where're you going?
Daddy, no!
The prom?  Kat has a date?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Thirty-two.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Don't make me do it, man
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
How much?
Fine, thirty.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
That's never been proven
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
My mission in life.

I know, just let me sleep
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Then why'd you ask?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Fallacy.
Hearsay.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Go to the prom with me
Why not?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Enough!
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Hi.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Thank God...
I am busy inside.
There'll be a time.
This time with me!
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Look out of that window.
He understands.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Damn God!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Twenty eight.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You think I don't know that?
The land is there.  I know it!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Can I see your back?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
So...the station is empty?
No.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Go on.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Yeah, right.
It's okay.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Describe him.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Alright?
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Not what.  Who.
That's unique.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Cut!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
A job?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You want the tape?  There it is!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
No way!  He's mine!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Yeah?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Your doctor?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Well, what is it?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Well, that does sound very odd.
I see.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
No chance.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
How much?
Jesus.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Luther's on the move...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Jack?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
You sure you want me to?
Jack, are you okay?
Jack?  What was that?
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Where is he?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How would you know?
Shut up.
Can't complain.
Sure, right.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Give it back.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
You know exactly where they are!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
No thank you.
They are robots!
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
It means, "Never without my permission".
What kind of mission?
When is she not in trouble?
That's what I'm saying.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I was talking to the cat.
Yes ma..
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Does it get any better or what!
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
Exactly.
Uh..
Actually only one cell survived..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
How much time is left?
Recommendations.
Yes, Sir!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
There's nothing harder.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
What can I do for you today?
Is it?
We can do that.
Machine's in?
I remember him.
You betrayed us.
I'm not so sure about this.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Eddie.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
What do you want?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Show me where you buried her.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Yeah... guess so.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Max.
Sounds good, pops.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Specialty product.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's their Presidential Suite.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm telling you it's not that.
The checks were for odd amounts...
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
No.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
I don't know.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
No.
What?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who are you?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
What's wrong?
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
About Freddy?
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's okay, Dan
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Been having bad dreams.
Who said I...wait, what?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Well we gotta do something!
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
All of us.  Right?
Faint.
Stick around, please?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I'd sooner swim!
Yes?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
Oh it does???
Something wrong?
What about time...?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
That's what I said!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
What?
Minus three.
- for horrors like yourself?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Same old shit.
Yeah. I know about that.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
What blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
He sure as hell won't.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
To us it was.
No.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Nothing.
What are you sorry for?
You mean Twombley?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Yeah.
Said what?
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Good.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Love! I'm made of love!
Everything you know is from me.
You think Jack shot him?
How was she?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about her?
I'm sure he's busy.
Some kids were teasing you?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Hey, you guys back already?
Been better, Dad... You?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Because it is my duty.
About goddamn time.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Dead.
Nine.
why did they do that?
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
No.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Can't it wait?
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
We're handling it, sir.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
Sir?
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Don't be too long.
I think so.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
What?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Well...not for another two hours.
That's right.
Certainly.
No.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
What is it?
Huh?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
That's right.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
But I-- .
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
When will Strader return?
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
We can't let him get away.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Who else can I ask around here?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Yeah, I'll bet.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
I can't!  Do you mind!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
...We're coming in.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Let's get these things lit.
Fuckin' A!
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
No.  Have you?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Hudson, give us a break.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Just get back here!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
No.. I've slept enough.
What about me?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
You're really something, ace.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did you ever have a baby?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Yes.
What??
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What does she want?
Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
I can't write it!
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
I was at hand.
He asked me to stay.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Be careful!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Who was your teacher?
Majesty.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Ah-ha!
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Yes?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Thank you, Sire!
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I will.
They say you're in debt.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
This is just a game, Papa.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
Bene.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Why not?
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
What exactly are you working on?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How could I not?
How could it not, Excellency?
Who are you?
Are you neglecting my request?
The man. He's here.
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
What?
We ended in F Major?
What time?
Also identical?
Yes!
You go fast!
Yes.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Ah - you've heard that?
My son, no one can speak for God.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I did.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes?
Did we?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor.
He said 'Jack'.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Warn him?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Call me Alex.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
That's not really a very proper question.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you think about it?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Now I'm embarrassed.
A werewolf?
Your dead friend Jack?
Lovely.
Okay.
The zoo?
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
No.
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
No, but we're about to.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
That's very funny, that is.
You could have told them!
What time is it?
Alex?
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Nice to see you.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I have no idea.
Yeah.
I don't know. Come on.
Not far enough. Come on.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
David!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
How shall I do it?
He's on the telephone.
No.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Aw, nerts!
Just pure luck!
What do you mean, help?
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Why, I needed a—
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Oh, yeah?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
I haven't any.
Why, I don't know.
Yes, sir.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Yes, sir.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
Oh, ten dollars—
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Nope.
Two.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You're not scared, are you?
She got two of them.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Sure, cousin.
What will be?
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you too, cousin.
Both would be nice.
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Where is Jesse James?
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
It's a secret.
I'd appreciate that.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
I figure.
I reckoned.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
What do you think?
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Oh yeah.
Got any ideas, little brother?
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
Shush.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Me neither.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
What?
Yes ma'am.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I'm not hanged yet.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I remember you.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Nice?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Yes.
Yes, dear.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Maybe.
I never knew you smoked.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Is your Evian spiked?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Yes, I am.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
How did you guess?
No.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
Where are you going?
Patrick?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, sir.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No, not really.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
That's...that's too bad.
Hello 
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Who do you ask?
No. Not really.
Hang...out?
No, he just hung out there.
What?
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
So who was he with?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm hungry
I'm hungry.
It's...it's...all right.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
'Gonna wait outside.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I remember.
Guilt?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
What?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
He wasn't acting?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
We tried!
I do!
...Do I?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
Definitely.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Gary, don't worry, we --
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Let's get him in here.
Where we going?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Then and now.  But not right now.
Why would you do a thing like --
Oh yeah?
Hmm?
Certainly not at my happy home.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
You mean -- break in?
Gary.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
I didn't plan this.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Groovy.
Or sometimes not at all.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Is it about my teeth?
We know all that, Exposition.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thanks.
Be careful.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Yes, Basil?
Thanks.
Yes Basil?
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Sure.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I'm sure.
I'm sorry.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Of course, luv.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Not now, Austin.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Hey, wait a minute--
Where did you learn to shoot?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Seriously?
No need. I'll call again.
... preserve...
Mr. John Steed, please.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
We have met ...
Rules are made to be broken.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
After the cold war ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To find out who killed my husband.
Thank you, Steed.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Ring?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
1922. Why the kippers?
Whereas you are.
Rules are made to be broken.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Do you really think so?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
For a man in my position --
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
You mean my other self ...
Any ideas?
Barely.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's called Black Leather.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Have you any place in mind?
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Who's now vanished.
I shall need a small plane.
So you say ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
She may try to kill you.
Guilty until proven innocent?
Both, actually.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
You wish.
Ugh ...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
You're kidding.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I'm marrying Debbie.
What is this person's story here?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
So does Debbie.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
But a fabulous cook.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Good...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
I am committed. I love you.
Let's get naked.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
I think I screwed that one once.
What are you...
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
That's it.
What do you mean, it changes?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Rick!
No, Brett, I...
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
This isn't right.
My gift to you.
Oooooo.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Who?
You got it.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Just come down, John. Just --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Saw what?
Everybody did.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Really? No kidding.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
How's it going?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Homey.
Then why did you quit?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yes.
Just take it.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I don't have the slightest idea...
It's a small town.
Hey, do I know you?
What?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
What are you listening to?
What reason?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
It's in my blood, Willy.
I was ahead of my time.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
Okay.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
I know you.
And old ladies?
Investigator Rimgale.
"Don?"
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Why?
Who?
Me?
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
All right. What are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Let's go NIGGERS.
Delacroix.
What's your name?
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Must be the pressure.
Meaning?
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
Well do something about it.
How you sound?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Exactly!
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
It's been a long time.
I didn't mean that, in life.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
This is Cheeba.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
Please don't go there.
Light?
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
I don't believe it.
It looks delicious.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I'll be right over.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you.  And always smile.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
You slept too near where you got in?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
A song a comin' I feel.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Y'know what?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Why don't you answer?
You can go now.
What is your uncle's name?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
It must have been some other gate.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Who?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Shut up, Mueller.
Shut up.  West's dead.
Okay.
I'm not telling you what happened.
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Epilepsy.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
How do you know that?
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I...
That's exactly what he says about you.
You're lying --
But not the only victim, right?
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I didn't --
Maybe --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You and the Colonel go back.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Excuse me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What happened next?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Good idea.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Get in.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Poor fucker my ass...
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Oh, you remember now --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
We've been making progress, I see.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
What the fuck are you doing?
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
There's only one I want.
Edward Bloom.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
What did she look like?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Lucky girl.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
I was dreaming.
Stop.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
I like your stories.
I can.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Am I?
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
You mean, while I'm here.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Hello.
Because he's dying.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's not true.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
No I don't.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
No I haven't.
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I'm asking what you're here for.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Good night.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
What? No you're not..
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And. It's wrong.
So now you hate all women?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
What?
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Except for Small Eyes.
Okay. Promise?
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Oh! Gave me a start.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
You liked what I brung ya?
At church?
I need ya help again.
No, ma'am.
Can I put it in your mouth?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
She's around. Always is.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Come on, gal...
Well I don't...
Why you got me chained?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What do you want?
No ma'am.
Let go of me...
I don't fuckin' cook.
You drink whiskey?
No joke.
I'm here with you.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Nothin'.
By myself?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Like I told you.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Ain't gonna be moved?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
I do.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Please don't tell my daddy.
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit!
Ronnie...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Thought you had a man for that.
The hell you call me?
Charlie...
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I don't think he'd feel it.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I can see that.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Kampai.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
Me too.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
You met her.
Tell them I'm not.
Why would you care?
Time, I've got plenty of.
Then take it from him.
Why me?
Look.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
Not to be trapped.
Then go get him.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Death.
Why?
Well, actually
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I think we're through for the night.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Yeah?
Huh huh.
True.
Nope.
You mean the snake.
I bet I would.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd never get an abortion.
It would be my child.
I think you need more help than you've got.
What do you want me to do?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
If she is, the machine works.
Thirteen.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Don't move.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
Pris.
I don't have one.
We sure did.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Just better.
You like it?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
How do you do?
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Oh, brother...
No, you get out of here.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
You don't?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Perry?
Oh, I could die...
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
What for?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
What?!
Good for you.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Good-bye!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Sing it to me.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No, son. A pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
Blow out the candles!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Merci!
Yes, sir. It's true.
Uh, I think they have.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Russia.
Yeah?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
No.
Almost all of them.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
My father is a genius.
Up there!!
Just look!!
How do you do, ma'am.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sorry, Mom!
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
You bet, hon!
Yes.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
The locks.
All our friends...
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Would you excuse me?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Have him committed.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Roger, Wolf One.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I've seen a few.
Yes?
Okay.
Yeah.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Jeffrey.
I wanted to see you.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
No, please. I won't.
What?
Frank? Can you stand up?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
I sure don't hate you.
What do you want?
Yes.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Here's to Ben.
Okay Frank.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Alright.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah. okay.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Yes.
Terrible boring.
That's too bad.
Maybe so.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Yeah.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
I can't dance fast.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead!
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Where's your gun?
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Connor, is that you?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Rocco!
Pee...Per...Man.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Why was I not informed of this?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
So?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Y-Yes my son.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
God have mercy on my soul.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
No. This is he.
That sets it off.
You think we're going to be chased?
You're right. You're right.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
Don't even say it, man.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No kidding.
As long as he gets out OK.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Don't panic, Anthony.
How much?
I know that. But --
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Right now.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I did.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Did that hurt?
I don't think you will.
He was all right.
Yes. I do.
Nobody move!
I don't know.
I'll get him.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Scale the --
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Why'd you want to help us?
What was that?
OK, Dad.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You think I'm improving?
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
No.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
God, yes. Like silk.
Uh-uh.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
So who's going to know?
I'll just drive my car.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Maybe she turned.
That's your domain.
His name was Swifty?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
I don't want to talk about it.
He wouldn't move.
I don't know.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
That's OK.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
He's having a heart attack or something.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
Did you hear that?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
He's damn good.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Well, I left some money in there.
No, my friend knows her.
Got a little lucky.
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Anything else?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Did he say anything to you?
'Why' would be enough for me.
No good options left?
What do you have, Danny?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I worry when you get like this.
He was at the campground yesterday.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
You do?
Yes.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
What do you mean?
Bourne?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
You mean, did I want a date?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot defeat this --
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
The Scots will fight for us?
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
That depends on the man.
We don't split up!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
No. He did not.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I... accept your proposal!
Nor I!
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
I must... consult with my father.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Weirder than this?
It's coming... argh! I can't!
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
Like Ozzy.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
Damn. Your dad did this?
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I walk differently?
What?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I thought I was the bad guy!
I'm sorry.
Oh my God oh my God...
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I'm sorry. It is.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Yes, sir.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
What are they?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
It doesn't matter.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Everything is quite all right.
And I said I would never leave you.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Goodnight.
We'll discuss it later.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes, rather.
Yes, I get the point.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
We'll be there.
Thank you.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
I see what you mean.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Victor Laszlo?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Excuse me.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Huh?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Catch another fish tomorrow.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Fix raft first.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
You can't go now.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
So did I.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
To life.
Believe me I know.
What?
Deep, real deep.
I need to do it.
Permission granted.
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Dr. Homer Wells.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
You cook very well!
I doubt it. She's just an...
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Really?
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Right.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Yes, I *have*!
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I know what you've been doing.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
I don't remember.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Is it true?
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
I haven't read that.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
And you have this letter of intent?
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
After you cut her loose.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Two million.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Eight A.M. flight.
That's it.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Help me.
Don't worry about it.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No, I want my cut!
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Then shut up.
Good point.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
In over your head?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
A Fed? Is he close?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Roger that.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Goodnight.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
What are you talking about?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
Not particularly.
I. sold the car.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I don't know.
Tension. It'll go.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
What about a drink on the way home?
You will?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I hate public transport.
Found a job?
You know where I'm from?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Your father?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Just an accident. Nothing.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Jack! It's Jani.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Nice car.
How long have you worked at the casino?
You've done pretty well.
Some other time.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't gamble.
I'll tell you later.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
Yes.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
All right, then...
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
No.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That is correct.
Yes, well...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Commander Powell is dead.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Bruno's girlfriend.
How I make my living, what's your point?
I'm on a break.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
What're you talkin' about?
No.
You mean until you showed up?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
No time.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
It's a rule.
They took my daughter.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
But why can't we stay here?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
When?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Too early to tell.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Something.
Yeah...
It was open.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
Hardly...
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Open it.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You don't want to.
Bastard...
I just don't go in with any expectations.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Where?
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You get it when I get her.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
We gotta talk.
I'm a toy to her.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Hawk.
Yeah?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Bye.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
One more time in English.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Curly.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Tickets?
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Hawk?
It's my Bullworker.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
A bustier?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Yeah.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Like a spear.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
You have to do something for me first.
Hey...
I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Are you okay?
Infant Memory Generators.
Hey. You OK?
But you're OK?
Where are we going?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Do they know yet?
Where it came from?
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I think about girls a lot.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
No. That makes you keep searching.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
The good stuff.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
Why?
Yeah.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
Donnie? You're a dick.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Really?
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
I just did.
Yes, Leslie!
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Okay. Take her purse.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
What?
The important thing is that we have a winner...
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Gladys! Stop it!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Uh, Gladys?
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
And everything.  He should be king!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
"My President"...
Send for my car...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Take a letter...
None of your business...  Take another letter.
I wanna powder my nose...
What's the matter with you?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Then you don't wanna work hard?
What do I get?
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
That's not bad for any day.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Go ahead.
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
That's it...
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
WHAT  ?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
This is terrible!
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yes please, two.
I've always thought that myself.
No, I think a whiskey.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
I intend to.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Good morning, sir.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
And what was that, John?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Say "Merrick".
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Thank you very much.
Oh yes.
Good morning.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Yes, very soon.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
But, Father, it IS!
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
It was different...
And the week before that?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I... but I...
The second note to wake the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Oh, get it over with.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I don't know! I just did!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
No.
What's it all about?
That's my boy!
Row! Row! Row!
Make your mind up.
What "magic"?
You'll see!
So?
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Well, come on!
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
What is it?
We'd be the first!
I was sitting there.
We haven't got a spare place.
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Over the Edge of the World.
He hasn't.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
Bastard.
That's it!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Well... I... I thought...
Relax!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I know, Dad.
I must only let the red rage...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Not now, Sven...
Sh!
Helpless...
Dad!
You liar!
Yes, Mum.
No, Mother.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Hi.
In the room?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Yeah?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Very much.
Yeah?
No.
Yes.
Where are you going?
I want to have a baby.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No, it isn't that.
No. Thanks.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I don't know.
I'm right here.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Yeah.
Naomi, I guess.
Egad, were you horrified?
Come up and see me... now.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Oh.
I love you.
I don't know.
Joel, come here. Please.
Make love?
Oh, um...
I don't know.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Long day thinking.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
You take it. I don't know.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I miss you.
Oh! Great. That's great!
We'll speak soon.
Very cool. Trippy.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
Well, what should we do?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
How do you mean?
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Oh dear.
That's fine, Stan.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Clockworks.
The Clock People?
Easy come, easy go.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
I don't.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
What is Debbie's position?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Like what?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Yep.
I'm the best.
Tired...
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Hold on, Coop...
On my way.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
No.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Thank you.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
There's no one here, Skipper.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
It's complicated...
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Yes...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
You know.
NOOO!
What is that?
Starck, give me a read.
We don't have time to fart.
Let's go.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
He's been past Mars?
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
She's not ugly.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Do they have pressure?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I like the sound of that.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Is it safe?
Victor must've taken him.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What about you?
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
But all these people...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
I think that thing is Ben.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
That's the temperature of the sun.
Dude. That's my sister.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Never better.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
What in the world would give me that idea?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You were?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Hilarious.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Reed, we're running out of time.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Oh, I think you already have.
Of course.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Well... it's true.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Get a ride with somebody.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I know it's yours.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
How often do you go?
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
That little prick.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
I'll get you the notes.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Awake? What do you mean?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Naked.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
What?
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Are you ready?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Where'd you get this?
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
I fear nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about!
We can't risk letting them in.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
OPEN THE DOOR!
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
And the rest of 'em?
And the head?
Easy.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Follow me.
Shit!
Just move!
What?
My truck.
We lived near power lines.
Well...
But --
The girl's got rhythm.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Nothing.
Holds four.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
No bullshit.
What?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Not without you!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
All right.
I'll do anything to help.
I said I'm not lying.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Who's this?
Very fine bone structure.
Thank you --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Thank you.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Right now we have to be practical.
Who?
Claire?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
What night?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thanks, Dad.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
And you think it's worth all this?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
Are you really serious? About acting?
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Don't touch me.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
...So you think I should go.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Kaminski.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Forget it.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I took the early rounds.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
How did I look?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I already have.
Yes, Ma.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I have!
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
Oh bullshit.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I see.
Stay calm, please.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Frances, I'm warning you...
Sedate her.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You speak.
How did you find me?
Kill me and have done with it.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
I don't know.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
And you?
All my life I've known.
Your decision. For us.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
It is
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
As a march hare.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Is that your diagnosis?
Thank you, Henry.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
The strain was evident.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Tomorrow is another day.
I was careless.
Good night, Brenda.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Thanks, Alice.
Sure.
Un-hunh.
Artist.
I don't know.
Almost five.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
They're off now.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Somebody'll see.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I had to.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Dancer.
That was the telephone.
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I call it my shower dream.
There you are dead wrong.
Those things can be nasty.
Another coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
So do I just follow you?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Scott and Kate.
My wife.
Yes.
Yes.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Pass.
Forever together.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
Yep.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Kate, Scott?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
It's a flop house.
Scott?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
What's in Mexico?
Me too.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your shower --
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Whatsamatter?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
I wasn't scratching!
He signaled the Ranger.
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
She's in the other room.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
We are?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Where are you right now?
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Who's "we"?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Your prerogative, Senator.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Didn't take long.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what --
Smoke her.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Yes, dear.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
No, ma'am.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Me?  Why me?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Yeah.  Me too.
Whose orders were those?
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.
You got anybody, Wick?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Mighta been civilian.
You heard me.  Move on.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Should I be afraid?
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's good to see you, Nick.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I got pretty close.
Speak of the devil.
That's the problem. He did.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
And you're beautiful...
It's your choice.
What?
We? I don't think so.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Me too.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
But you don't know for sure!
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Why do you need that?
You were right.
Just don't.
Is that the bathroom?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Could they be the miners?
What?
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
Right.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Hey, YOU want to drive?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Tell them? About...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Let me think. I need time to think.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
What the hell are you talking about?
Right.
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Home.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
But...Why?
Wh... Where are we?
Push It. Hold it down.
Okay, let's go.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
They always say that.
What does she see in them?
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
Lafayette will not be happy...
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Yes, I believe so.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Gag on your own invention, then.
You invented this, this...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
The man is a traitor!
I only meant...
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
My God, what?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I think I heard that.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Some things must never change.
I want you to see our hospital.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Calm down, Bear...
You spotted them, huh?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
That's right, me.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
What money?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
Gimme an hour.
What?
It's a different kind of deal.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Look at me, Ray.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I don't like waiting.
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
So you don't work for the casino?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
He drown?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Read it. It's a grabber.
You're kidding, right?
Never say anything unless you have to.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
He died.
Personally?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Who told you that?
What're you doing here?
For any movie.
"Cotton".
Depends, who pays?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You're as bad as Harry...
Go get your stuff.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
Come on in.
Harry -–
That's where you got the idea?
Shylock?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Bring it on, dude.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Why not?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What is it?
The right way and the wrong way.
How about you Epps?
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
What is it?
You smashed it!
Conveniently enough for you.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Then you're a lucky man.
I bet you did.
Probably didn't have time.
Lights?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Nope.
So what did happen?
Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.
Yup.
Epps.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
That much I think we've already established.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Alright. I'll be right up.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You're up late.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Lost my sea legs.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
A what?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Who?
YES.
God, how horrifying.
Nothing.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
No.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hey Josh.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Why?
Forget it...
How perfect.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Okay, okay!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
She says she wants to MMPH!
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What are you talking about?
It's always closed...
It'll only take a second.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
What? Where?!
I don't believe you.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Which one?
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I don't believe you.
Great...
I said "great"...
Well, we won't keep you.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Tell me what?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Get a job!
You don't know what you're talking about.
What?
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Hi, it's me...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
And you like them?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I will if you want to.
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I am.
Right, exactly!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why? What did she tell you?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
You never had it.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
We have hunted since childhood.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
Might be exciting for you.
I can try.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Not even close.  What happened?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Does he ever mention me?
I won't.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I'll supervise.
We definitely had a moment or two.
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Oh, hello, Peter.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Tonight?
The Upper West Side.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
-- the sorrow --
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Did I forget something?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
You were the one who got me in.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Something good --
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
I hate Jello.
I'm ready.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
Wonder what?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Hi, Louis.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
What?
Well, let's check it out.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Thank you.
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
In a storage facility.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
That's "Peck!"
A square?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What have you got, Egon?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
What?
Does she want to be?
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Looked at with your eyes.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Where are you, Pete?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Mmmhmmm.
LATER, MAN!!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
Do you want posters, too?
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
Caesar?
They won't break this one.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
He left us at dawn.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Yours will do!
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Tomorrow?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I was summoned.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
I'd love some.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No, I couldn't.
No.
Wait a minute.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
You do?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
No.
Here? In Berkeley?
Here he comes.
All right then! Yes!
What?
Did you say rape her?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yes.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
No, Benjamin.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Hello -- who is this?
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Who screamed?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
I am going to call the police now.
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
A single. Just for myself, please.
What? No. Nothing.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
No. 
What for?
What do you drink?
No.
Yes.
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Well I don't know.
It's all right.
Sit down.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Jesus Christ!
Yes.
Waiter!
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Not exactly.
What?
Yes.
Art.
How do you think.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I don't think we were the first.
What?
Don't talk about Elaine?
There's nothing to tell.
May I stay then?
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Where is Elaine?
Sir?
Goodnight, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
When I go off?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Goodnight, Benjamin.
No.
Goodnight.
What about it?
To be what?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
That has nothing to do with it --
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Ben -- how old are you now?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Mr. Robinson?
Can you look through the glass.
That what he says. Right?
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
I could take care of her.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
No --
What about the money?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
You're very funny --
Chasing what?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And...?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I don't want them now.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
For Vienna?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Bless you --
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Yes, quite.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
All right then.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
I thought she was splendid!
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Everything?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- that --
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
You pay me.
Moreover...
Movies?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well -- you want me?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
I had to arrange about the trip.
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Next week.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I'll loan you a raincoat.
What's that, Lilly?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I like you, too.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
These machines -- They're in here.
I know.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Hello.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
You don't have the stomach for it.
I pay my debts.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I know you do, so that's why --
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Taking you for granite?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You called the doctor, huh?
That's just Lilly's way.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
I'm a salesman.
Where?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Not many.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Only the real stiffs.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Betcha' didn't predict that.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
I was trying to get away from someone.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
No.
I don't know.
Just get on the bus.
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Okay... thank you.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What?
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
What is it?
You're unbelievable.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
He's in the bathroom.
Then they can watch.
You can't expect us to stay here --
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Him.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
Or what's left of him.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No one.
I dunno, boy.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
They were enemies.  We were at war.
You've come to the right man.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
Out!  Out!
Are you--do you--
I'll see.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
"The sting."
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Penelope!
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Nothing would please me more.
Have some.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
I did?
A trip, you mean?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
Yes.
What are you going to do?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Rifle?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Blue soup?
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
Out!
Oh dear.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And her fiancé!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
And terror, if you don't mind.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
No!
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
What will you do, Colonel?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Yes.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
I don't care what she wears.
Don't worry about it.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Don't know.
That man is your father.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He isn't any friend of Father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Something happens to my confidence.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
How long has this been going on?
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
What?
Tonight's the night.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
I'm amazed.
He's not your son.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
It's good.  Let him go.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
You mean I'm black?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Are you going to stiff me?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Wait?
How many weeks?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You know her?
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
No.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
You don't understand shit.
No.
But it's all you do.
What do you care about?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
On your own land?
But what?
What makes you so sure?
...What do you have to offer?
Mr. Van Dorn?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
What have you found out?
Where is she?
What do you mean?
No.
But the police...
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
I just heard. Who is he?
What plan?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Who?
Film making can be pretty expensive...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Oh.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You're taking a big chance.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
No.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Where are the papers?
Not very.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Nice to meet you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
No.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Well...
But we can't just dig it up!
It is kind of rough.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yes. It's almost there.
Of course.
I like you, Maude.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
I don't know. Perhaps.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
I took them out.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But why now?
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
What?
I don't care what people say.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
Like a tea ceremony?
Does that worry you?
Why?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
War is not all black.
You think so, sir?
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Yes.
Souvenirs?
Harold!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
I know.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
If anyone can help, HE can.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Kyle, you don't have...
It's been Hell.
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
See what??
Is he serious??
You mean, outside... with her.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Red, I found something --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
I think that is its hand.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Yes?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Goodnight.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Red, I --
I like that...
Doesn't sounds like him.
Two steps back, please.
I have to speak to my father.
I don't remember.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
One last time. Give me the box.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh my God.
Keep your voice down.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Let me see.
There's very little I can do about it.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Oh my God.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
No. I'm not.
I hear you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Sure.
O.K.
Kirsty.
No. I'll do it.
It's better you see for yourself --
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
I... suppose so, yes.
That's right.
Am I?
Wait a moment --
Surprise.
Sure.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Really?
I want to see.
I thought we'd lost you.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What happened to you?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
But now I kind of like it.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Ehh.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have all of the others.
It's the new --
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
Why?
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Can I help you?
Fine.
I want a tape.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
Is what better?  Better than what?
I don't have your number.
You do, huh.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Is that the last of it?
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Hey, how ya doin'?
No, no.  When are you going home?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Uh... No.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
You're tougher.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Fair enough.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
It's true!
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Thank you.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
That way.  You?
Right.
Everything all right?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Well we don't.
Sure.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
No thank you, I'm fine.
I don't follow you.
The boy _died_?
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Where?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
You?
No one knows you're here?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
They do it each year.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
At least.
I see.
He knows about you.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Yes.
Four?
It'll never stick.
Never take up poker, Detective.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
It's that important?
Your name is Conor?
Pheasant.
Why are you here?
Not even a single lifetime.
This can't be.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
It's like to kill me first.
That is not me.
I have no future husband.
But I did live.
Who?
Do what you must.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Not likely.
Mulet.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
We have no understanding.
I had no choice.
Must he go?
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
Kahn?
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
It doesn't.
What are you getting at?
That's none of your business.
A mystery.
His only kid.
Same.
Hildy!
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Hello, Bensinger.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Sort of a Jack London style?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
No -- she didn't.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
What's the matter?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
I'm not working for any other paper!
What's his line?
The insurance business?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
You're not afraid, are you?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Thank you.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
I know. Where is he, I said.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
How much do you want on it?
What tickets?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Who did you talk to?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Thanks.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What's the matter with my brains?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
What's that -- what's that?
You grey-haired old Judas!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You got plenty of money?
I'm busy, Duffy.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
What have you got, Hildy?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
That's all right.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Hold her, boys!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Just -- one -- second!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Five hundred dollars.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Editorials?
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
That man there!
Very simple, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
You're insane!
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Why?
Bloody.
Ask her yourself.
...and six...
I'm starting my own collection.
The sodding water table.
It's like telling fibs.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
Kiss me Hardy.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Jam.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Grace!
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
We did the decent thing.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Where's that?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
How awesome?
I know, this is fucking nuts.
He won't move.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
There's a dog in the road.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
She looks like she stinks.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I don't doubt that.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
No, just a little too old.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Well, go get her.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Right.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
French?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Of course not.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Hmmmph.
Stop. Get away.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Unnhh.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
No. You look so beautiful.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Shut up and tell me.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
Lila, I want to help you.
With pleasure.
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
You are a therapist, right?
What's the larger experiment?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm not sure.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
No biggie.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
That's a great idea.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Of course.
Fifteen.
Yes.
That's very funny.
A deer?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Good. Making progress.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
No.
Sure. Of course.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Have you?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
here, here.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Yes?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
You want a chaser?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
What is?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Whaddya been so far?
Why?
You think I can lose?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Where do I sign?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
'Bout even.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
It's a long walk.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Fast and loose, man.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Oh no, nothing for me.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Half and a dollar.
Call it.
What?
Since four.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Then why go to the bus station?
I used to be an actress.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm not.
I drink.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Haven't you opened it?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
You wanna drink?
What's it so hot in here for?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Why?
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Game's over, Eddie.
Let's go.
You lived like this once.
What?
You're not them.
What do you mean?
Have you always had it?
Have you looked inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Please.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
What, Jim, what?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
No.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
All their lines were busy.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What? -- I... 
What?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What kind, Mom?
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
More than likely.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can you believe this?
Haven't you been watching?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
College nickname.
What'd I say?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
ETA with target; four minutes.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Sorry for what?
How to kiss ass.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I didn't even see them fire!
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
But, Mr. President...
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Die.
What is it?
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Dad was onto something here!
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
What?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I usually don't.
Lower me down.
What?
How do you know?
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
I came to get you! What do you think?
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Don't worry. He won't.
So did I.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What?
Brody's this way.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Relax.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Fly... yes. Land... no.
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
It happens to me all the time.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Penitent. Penitent...
"J".
That was seven hundred years ago.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Step on it, Short Round!
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
No.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
What evil?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
The old man saw it in a dream.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Keep stroking it!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
What does the writing say?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
Just try and control yourself.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Quiet!
You've got to go to sleep now.
No... they won't kill me.
Go!
What above the curves?!
Not quite.
You got it!
Al ???!!!
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
Al.
Yes.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
You're gonna explain.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Too late...They want you.
We have to get out of here.
Go out, take your first left.
I can't remember..
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Don't know.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Nothing!
I'm at the airport.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
What is it?
Little late for that.
You eat it.
Follow it.
Don't just stand there, say something.
...Rene...
Rene...
Why not?!
The beautiful one.
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
I don't know what's going on.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Is that all?
Shit! You're in love.
Follow her.
What do I do?
You think. That's what you're good at.
Don't worry!
Drink lots of water.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Not sure at all.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
I can't handle that thing.
Aim what?
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
I'll get us out of here.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Aren't we all.
Don't give her your name.
Let us get to the border!
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
He work for us?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
I think I've heard of you.
What things?
Do what?
Remember what?
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Oh.
I will?
The little man in my...  ...head...
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Sir?
Nothing.
Yes?
Yes, of course.
That you're not crazy.
Is that Ryuji?
What do you mean?
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Get your things.
Oh sure.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Beats me.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Can you?
It was my choice.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
A drink...
Why?
Perfectly.
Poor bastard.
Okay.
That remote control thing?
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Okay.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me Wigand.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Hey, Lowell.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
How are you, Jim?
Catch you later.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Call me back in ten.
Yes, it's on the stove...
Try the car.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Hello? Yeah...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Alright.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, lots.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Everything interests me.
What I've seen... I've liked.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Tempura...
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I don't think you really understand --
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
No.
ABC...?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
There is -- there is no family.
Right.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Triple!
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
It's your move, Miles.
What?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Ruth Rabino.
It's about time.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Did you see the tape?
What does your lawyer think?
But you don't agree?
Why would you be here?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
Gotcha.
Absolutely.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
She didn't love you?
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Yes.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Oh Miles!
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Hello Miles.
Murder?
I thought so.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
You used his credit card.
He was right, wasn't he?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
She did a Harriman.
Of Massey Myerson?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
I wish I had your discipline.
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
I guess.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Heh heh.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Nothing.
What are they?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
-- the coin?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Mother?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He's marvelous!
Is that his name?
I suppose so.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Yes, of course.
You win!
Are you talking to me?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You must have me confused with—
Beat it! 
Shut up!
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Outside!
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
I refuse to resign!
You're prejudiced.
Oh, Peter— 
was so scared—that it scared—
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
You're an expert, I suppose.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
A black eye. 
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yeah, swell.
Me?
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
When does the bus leave?
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Yes?
Just your imagination.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Okay, pete. 
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
ain't got a hat—
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Who?
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Yeah—wouldn't it?
What?
Why?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Why—no—
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Where you going, boss?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Why Galveston?
And then Sunday?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
What?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
How many shots you say you heard?
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
Nonsense.  What next?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Huh?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
What are you driving at, boss?
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
The Warren Commission call him?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Was he there often?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
The assassination, Jack?
Splendid, love to see them.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Yes?
Virginia.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
I won't forget.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She almost sounds scared.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Can you do it or not?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Okay.
In cash.
I thought you might want a drink?
Shit.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Sure.
The Delfonics.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
He called you?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Surprise.
What'd ya see?
Right around here, in the food court.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Why?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
More or less.
Do you think they bought it?
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
What do you tell Nicolet?
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I hesitated taking that much.
You'll get over that.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I beg your pardon?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
No.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Who's the other one?
What did you say?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I thought you were watching him.
Buy ya a beer?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Great...  ...Wanda!
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Do you got something for me?
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Go sit over in that chair.
Baby, I didn't --
I told them.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
It's true, isn't it?
So we need two people, two women.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I need to talk to you alone.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Uh-huh.
The roller disco one.
Detroit.
You lived in Japan, when?
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Who's your partner?
Then what?
You're outside?
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Sure.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Maybe the Feds got it.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Watcha gonna see?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
You think you could do that?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
She got off, huh?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
I know where to turn.
No.
You know it's for you.
Give me his home number.
Then what are you doing here?
No, don't. But thanks.
Yeah, ever since that ...
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Oh God!
I could have told you that.
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
I'm hanging up.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Why do you say that?
What else did he say, Jake?
He told me he was going to Hell.
... I've seen them, too.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
What did she have to say?
What?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
It's freezing.
Save me!
No. Don't move me.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Where to?
I don't know.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Show me Della!
Get your clothes off.
Get your clothes off!
That's your decision.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Here. I'll do it.
What?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Stay away from me, Jez.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Sit down, Jake.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm tired.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
What is it?
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
No. I couldn't.
I no from around here.
Help me!
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Nothin' much.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
What's goin' on Paul?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
You've seen them?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
You come home with me.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Get out of here!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Where'd you get the gun?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
And now we're all out of it.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
My job.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
I hope so.
No you don't!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
And what happend to ...?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Oh sure, all the time.
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think so, why?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Oh I like her a lot.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Would you?
Later.
Oh my God! Adrienne?
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Are there any other shuttles?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I love you.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
What?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Obviously so.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
What have I done?! Idiots.
Sure but what good will that do?
Here --  Take him home.
You got it.
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Do you see the kids?
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
What'll I tell the kids?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Why?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Be careful, for chrissake.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
No...  You think we can get back with those?
I can't imagine why.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Twenty years.
Do I set the goddam hook?
You're leaving?
He's busy.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I'm okay...
I think I can top that, Mister...
I don't have it.
I don't think so.
Thanks for the message.
Cool.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I'll try to drop by later.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Well, I do.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
Oh.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Yeah.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
That suits you.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
I actually know this one.
What's the matter?
I went to the doctor today.
This is the baby. Your baby.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I am a suicide risk.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Unfortunately, yes.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Right, seriously.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Keith's hot.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
They're yellow.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Hm.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Don't mock me.
Yeah, downtown.
It's a loft.
Adele for god sake please lis...
How'd you meet Early?
Could I try that?
Sure.
No it is not!
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
Jeez... Adele!
That's not true!
Early, you are so sweet.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
What do you need a Bible for?
How much do I owe you?
Dahlia, no.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
If you say so.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
The party?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
I still think we should have met them first.
Funny, very funny.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
I don't want to talk about it.
How do you know that?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Why, what did he do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Not yet.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Yeah.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
What?
Did you tell her that you loved her?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Yeah.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yeah me too nigga.
Oh. You like her?
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I do what?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
You were?
Nothing?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
No, Fidget, I...
No...
Why is that?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
But I only had sex with Telly.
What?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Making love is like.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
What?!
Shh.
It's very monotonous.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
You are!  I don't like you.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
What do you want?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
No, I need the original note.
Get off me!
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Anything?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
He was with me?
Just a second.  Hello?
Did you know her?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Because she's the type.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Very good.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No!  Wait!!
You don't understand.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
You're losing me.
Uh huh.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Nice meeting you.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Who's Kathy?
Bingo.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
But we heard him.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What does that mean?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I got it from the tournament directory.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
I went out.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Because I think he's wrong.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
And you?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
What's wrong?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Frank told me.
I'm sure you are.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
But there is another entrance to this place.
You have rope?
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
Where the spiral begins.
No! You cannot know that!
Yes. It is today.
Yes.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
He saved our lives.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Hand over your dinner.
Yes, my lord.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Would you settle for a boar?
I have a cinnamon bar.
I'd wish for a puppy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Oh, my poor stomach.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Hush!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
She has the power to kill.
Her name is Death.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
That is true.
Ynyr!
The most beautiful woman in the world.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Where is he? My son.
It is no trickery.
No?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...What?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Whoever.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
What shall we do?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Later.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Don't you like me?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Nothing, for the moment.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Yes... Twice.
No it's not.
What?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
That's enough.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
You're talking to me?
Please tell me.
He's plastered.
Good.
Pacifica, California.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You tell stories?
What was that?
By car right?
You're amazing.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
So I've been informed.
What Mr. Parker?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes.
What do you mean?
This isn't right.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
You what?
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Are you serious.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
No?
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
We?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just forget it?
Can we just ignore it?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Let's stay for a while.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Thank you!
Just the love in my heart.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Spill.
No!
What's the point?  Look at me.
You know her?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really?
Did she do that to you, too?
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
How do you figure?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Are you asking me on a date?
What happened?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I got bangs!
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Where's the Rock?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Always.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
What do you want with me?
Not from me, surely...
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Oh, yes...
What will become of me then?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And, now?
I didn't know... I --
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I fear she's lost.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Will you lead me to her?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Something's coming.
The colt's still too small.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Blackheart?
What know you of fields of war?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
The chill is worse this night.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
I don't... understand.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where?
I'll try.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
If you like.
Never.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
I'll go search for it.
Shhh!
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I don't want it on me.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
You're teasing still.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Is she fair, this princess?
As fair as me?
You'll visit again?
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Sorry.
Do I not please you, Jack?
Jest with me then.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You... you... you mortal you!
Heading north still?
I think she's about to foal.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
That very nice.
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
We can work.
Sam!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Here, honey!
And why was the alarm on?
Who are all these people?
Is that legal?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Yeah.
Why are you so stupid?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Are you afraid of heights?
What?
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
A violation?
How's your wife?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I'll ask.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
I'll hate you forever.
It'll be fine.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The gloves on the table are for you.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Hi, Mom.
Nothing.
What do you know about me?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Yes.
You lied to me!
I'd build a house.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I know there's an explanation.
Three.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Where is he?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Well, for later then.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
My stupid back.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I think so.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
What did I say?
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
No.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I never asked for more.
Please don't leave me.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
No.
Yeah.
Yes, it is.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Yes, boss.
Yes, sir.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I know it begins with a "C"...
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Claude Banks.
Good old Monroe.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
A loan officer?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
What'd you say?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Here I am.
So you made a generous contribution.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddy's watch.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
So?
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Him?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That was five years ago.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Why ain't that pick swinging?
You heard the boss! Let's move!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
He must still be in there.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Me? Willie Long.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
And he's dead serious.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
My mom wasn't a goat?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Put it in your mouth.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
How bad?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's a pretty brassiere.
I know, your wickedness.
What was it called, sir.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Peppermint... alright.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Yes, great movie...
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
Why are you laughing?
If you want to.
Basically, yeah.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
From my dad's side of the family.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
All right -- what are you?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm Mary 2.
I'm very smart.
Please... No.
He was killed.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
No.
K.
A Runner gave it to me.
Some people say children need human mothering.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
To what?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
I don't know... but it does.
What's that?
At least it's over...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
I don't know.
It's me...
Me, too.
Are you positive he knows?
Pete... Don't...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
Okay.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Sit down.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Out in back.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Coming up.
No... I don't. Why?
Not even close.
FUCKIN' "A".
The first night... Not the last two.
Two detectives are coming out.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
All right!
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Yeah?...
Sorry... I...
I don't know.
What night?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Come on.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Yes.
Well, what do you know about that!
I see.
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Okay, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Thank you.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes, charming.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thank you.
Pardon me—
Oh, dear.
Father Perrault is dead.
What is it, my son?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Mine?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
All right. Sorry, George.
So you think I'm mad?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Oh, George . . .
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why?
It's Fenner.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Yup.  Sure is.
Kay...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Why?
Let's check am out.
A what?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I'd double it and add 20.
Do his job.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Actually, you may have.
What is it?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
It's... coming.
Noon exactly.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
What if I don't?
I wanna make a deal.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
May I have a look?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Where's he making his big speech?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Can you see?
Agatha...
Forget that guy --
What is it?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Oh, Jesus...
What --
Then who was he?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
-- go blind.  I know.
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Lara --
Yes, sir.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
I'm fine, Lamar.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We're in motion on something.
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Just a nickname.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
That's right.
They don't belong to anybody.
I guess that's all of it.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Hold your breath, Dad...
NO!
No.
I'm a little dizzy...
The what?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
He's dead, Lara.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Sean --
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Lamar --
Tell him not now.
My God...
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Wait, just a second...
I don't understand --
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
I forgot my glasses.
I know who you are.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
You mean after he lost your son.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What are you talking about?
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
So?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Manhattan.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Chloe?
What time is it there?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. Where is he?
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
This one?
Pshhh...
She was fast, huh?
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
I'll work it off.
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Yeah.
What is it?
What drill?
Good morning.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Well, this is the corner.
Don't be shitty.
I know the number.
We don't need guns.
Bullshit...
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Nah, don't bother --
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Yeah, I guess.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Fuck...
Don't even start.
What did I 'get?'
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
What's up?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
You want us strapped, don't you?
The what?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
We don't need guns.
Why?
You're out of money?
Eighty bucks?!?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
I'll be a minute.
Fuck...
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Yes.
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Does anyone want another?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Here...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Soho Grand, right?
You'll love it.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're going to New York?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
So tell me how it is.
Goodbye.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
What?
I'm working on it.
I'll take your goddam bet.
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You know it.
I don't want your money.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Okay, okay.
What do you do with your time?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Next week, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
If you want to tell me.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
Yes.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
The talk is everywhere!
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I'm tired of praying.
Is my family here yet?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Let me do it then.
Allah Akbar.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
I ain't stupid.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Murder.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
What does Sidney say?
And don't come back.
C'mere.
Me?
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Fine as May wine.
Eat lead, coppers.
I ain't doing bad.
Tell him about Baldy.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
So what about him?
I'm the man.
Allah will provide.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[South America.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
I'll call you tomorrow.
[What is his name?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Who ordered it?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Don't lie to me!]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
I drink.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
I came to visit you.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
How do you think he got out?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
No, that was in Columbia.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You got that right.
Never.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Because...  I was already dead.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
It's Creasy.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
For a year?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
I'm trying, mom.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Our daughter.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[And left three more dead men.]
So am I.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
And they took that away.
Oh, yeah.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
It must be one o'clock.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I came to see you. How you feel?
It's her baby too, you know.
You told me.
What happen?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm thirty-four.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
I'd like that very much.
How do you do?
We just live one flight up.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I'll see you around.
That's the one.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
You gonna die without a son.
Marty...
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Well...
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hello, Thomas.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Back home.
No.  Or why you should.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
There's only one way.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Perfectionist.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
We're a good team.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
I can't... couldn't.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
A football game?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Right.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't get it.
They're coming.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Not necessarily.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Same here.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
I didn't mean with me.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
I don't think so either.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Good morning.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Now?
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
You got me.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
No, thank you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
All set, Ann?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Plus a bonus.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Oh!
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Did you find her?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
The heelots!
The heelots!
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
How?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Nineteen!
Yeah.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Shh!
You want me to go up with you?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I need to get something straight first.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Automatic.
Is there a problem?
...a car.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Only at the very end.
Is there something wrong with that?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
I think I can handle that one.
I do.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Greg.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
If you did, you never showed it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah that's it.
Scottie...
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
Use your imagination.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
What?
Define concern.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
I want to be put on this case.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Okay...
To live forever.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
-- No.
No...
Guests?
Wake up?!
True.  But why?
Unfinished business.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
What about the customers with reservations?
The weather.
Who?
Go!
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Good question.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Katie was digitized.
-- You told me.
Who are you?!
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Realize?
Yes.
Male.
-- Standard.
Uplink selected.
They're called squirbs.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
Activating Power Beam!
What does that mean?!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
Ryan's Comet!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
We could smell it's breath.
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Look closer.
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Why should I be?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
If we have to.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
You got men on Profaci's place?
That ain't what your mama said.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
For being a bootlegger?
I must be going.
I was calling yesterday.
I needed to see you again.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
So what is the problem?
Like a party for all our friends.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Might as well put the time to use.
Who?
What's your problem?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Not if they all die at once.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
And the Jews?
I found that out.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
You disrespect our tradition.
Masseria's been after me too.
We can operate around these guys.
Spare us.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Bend over?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
How much?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Why?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Ohhh, nothing.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
I'd better go report this...
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Mother!
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
I'm sorry.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
I can make my own decisions.
Yeah.
Moscow.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
Looks like it, but--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Who?
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Paine.
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
Is the wind tired out there?
Have *you*?
Do we *have* to?
What?
Take me home, Diz.
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
He's a house-afire!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Oh--Jim!
Than what?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Look! There it is!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For a question!
For one week!
I yield.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Here--where are you running off to?
Good as new! It's quite all right--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
What?
We'd better see.
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
The man downstairs said number--
J-Jefferson Smith.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Convene?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Right.
Committee, huh?
Yes, I see that.
We're over in the House.
Thanks very much.
No.
Have I?
Why?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
It *is* not!
No!
No! Stop it!
Don't mention it--
I'm not.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
"So help me God."
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
What's the matter?
Let's get away from here. 
Go away, Nosey.
Okay. See you here.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Do you?
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes, sir.
No!
Yes!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh - uh - nothing.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Really?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Yes.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Sure!
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I'll get my hat.
Are you? When?
Yes, of course.
Nothing.
No. It's nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Yeah, then what?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
We're not going out tonight.
Hello.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Last night he proposed to me.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Shhh!
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
This is outrageous!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
When?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Huh?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
What're you talking about?
Arthur wants to quit!
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We own an opera house, don't we?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Ja.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I don't know.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
South Dakota north.
Yeah. What?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
Looking for?
Who?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Yeah.
No!  What do you want!!
Uh-huh. What are they?
What happened?
Doubtful. What did he say?
Take your time.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Go to hell.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
My pleasure.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
I've had my moments.
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
I'd better get in there.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
...so accomplished.
You're good.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Why don't you tell me?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Is she against you getting help?
Sorry... I'm done.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Yeah?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I think so.
What was that?
Hello.
What do you want me to see?
Was it something that happened at school?
Uh-huh.
Do you think that's what he wants?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Really?
I understand.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
This is exactly what I wanted.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Really?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
What?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
In the desert? What for?
What does he want the book for?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Perhaps.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I am an English woman.
Proceed!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Got what?
I have no choice.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Um, well, you see...
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Of course.
Really?
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
When was that?
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
What did he mean?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
It's me... Elizabeth.
He's dead.
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
I'm not that kind of girl.
Curiosity.
You're a spy.
I saw him walk you home.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Why?
It is?
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
And what if you get killed?
Monica!
And you are a fool.
LOOK!
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Are you coming or not?
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Definitely.
Shut up.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
With or without him, we gotta go!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
May I come to the map?
Are you serious?
Cavalry?
Any cannon?
Where are they?
I'm not insulted.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
But who made this treaty?
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
Ajaccio.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'll have the fire built up.
Yes, I am, sir.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
And you, Junot?
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
One had better legs.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
All right -- I promise.
I know what you're doing in there.
Yes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
God help me -- yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Does she deserve anything better?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
That is a matter of opinion.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Yes, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
That's it?
Good.
I don't know!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
You don't know Baby D.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Okay, plan B.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't.
Still gonna smell it.
Nothing.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I don't know.
Better sooner than later.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Well bring yo' ass on...
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
It's alright.
I'll remember.
Come on.
Yeah, pops!
What up, bro?
Negative...they vamped.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Why did he go in the house?
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
20 minutes?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I don't know, Debo.
I don't know.
Nothing.  What you want?
Take your car.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
I threw my back, again.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
What?
San Diego.
What?
Oh, yeah?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Ah.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
What?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes, I'm listening.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Tell me why I miss him.
You fucked up.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
I want'to talk to her.
Don't you threaten me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Over and out.
I promise.
Oh, man...
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I think this is worth a dollar.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You're a big girl, huh?
Keep your eyes peeled.
'Daddy has to go now.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Hm!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Dad, you're bleeding...
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
I been mindin' Pearl.
No.
Don't!
She went.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Walt!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Bluebeard!
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Mister Powell!
Satan.
There! What's so hard about that!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
She talks to herself.
Dead.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Is that all?
Huh?
It -- she --
I'll tell.
What?
Mm-hm.
Naturally.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Because John said I mustn't.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I -- no, I --
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Them kids!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
When did I ever?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Uh-oh...
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Hi.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Deal.
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Right home after. See you.
I will.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Dead and gone.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
He's nuts about you.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
It's from Paris.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
No, no.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
You didn't get legal advice?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Oh, yes, yes.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Go to bed.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Count d'Algout...
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
While you eat, you look at the view.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
I'll send you a muff.
A day.
A cow?
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Monsieur.
That's even better.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
We did it with the best intentions...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Au revoir.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
What business?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Oh no. No visa.
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
You might hold this for me.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Go ahead.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Wounded? How?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
No.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
What, darling?
Let's turn on the radio.
No, no music.
Yes, sweetheart. 
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Is this your new dress suit?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
How do you do?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Go on.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
What?
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
'Night, Al.
Cox!  Fire him.
How do you see this?
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
What do you mean, sir?
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Sir?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
No ...
Sir ... six bodies.
Why me?
What about happiness, Mother?
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
What?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
I always get my man.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
The American people put me where I am.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Free, if you're the president.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Mr. Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
That's right.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Are you serious?
Then I'll be there for you.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
They're all your enemies?
You personally?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
They were for me.  They're mine.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
I'm... discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Some pretty bad people.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
The old boy shot by the highway?
You figure him for a dope runner?
No. Probably I don't.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I always am.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
No. But I gave my word.
It's full a money.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
That'll work.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I know something better.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
You from around here?
I see.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What time do you close?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
You married into it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
No.
...Where you want me to put it?
That's twenty-six dollars.
No sir, it's unusual.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Yessir. I understand that.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know how he found me.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
To kill your wife.
What product.
I don't know. American citizens.
I don't know.
I got an overcoat on.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
No, Elden, I need to...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
"Banners?"
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Umm, I don't think that...
"Thirty-two?"
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I'm sorry.
...what're you saying?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Yes, ma'am.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No, Del.
You knew Del?!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Like Rome?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
He has no heartbeat!
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Who?
...okay.
He is real.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
My socks?
Beer, please.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Hell of a way to die.
He told us it's in the Buick.
...that's a good motto.
Should I kill him now?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
No.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
A doctor on the show... why?
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
"Injuns?"
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I'll think about it.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
What the hell's going on?
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Sure.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
David Ravell.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Waitaminute -
- and share one of your graves.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Okay, Everett.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Everett, my beard itches.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Helluva awgazation.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Now Penny, stop that!
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
But... but...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
I been calling for four months.
Great.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I wrote. Not every week...
Pity you don't have the character.
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No.
No, sir.
No, sir!
Zack, don't!
What are you tired from?
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Yeah.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Great.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
My kinda group!
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Any time, sailor.
What's stopping you?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
What would you do differently?
Your real father?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
I can't risk it.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Shhhh...
Sure.
Naw.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
The fuck did you do that for?!
I can't...
This is ridiculous...
You know how this gotta end.
Not that one.
I know.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
They're gonna die in there!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Adios.
Huh?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Not at all.
Don't!
No fucking way.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Why?
Got us in here, didn't I?
The crowd goes wild.
People.  In the house.
PANIC ROOM!
What am I, a five year old?
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
"Titanic."
Come on, come on...
Blue is phones?
On it!
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Yeah, it's me.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
I don't know. Look around man.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Jesus...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
We need money first...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Maybe...
Just the legit shit.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't look alright.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
No, he takes after his mother...
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Lovely.
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
With a lace table cloth?
Oh?
Very well, proceed, sir.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps.
The middle colonies?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Oh?
Flanking riders?
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Father?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
What?
Granted.  Where are you going?
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
He left us.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Thirteen years...
That's five, keep going...
Gabriel.
Thank you.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
But what about Thomas?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
When?
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Yaay!
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm sure you're not.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
I swear.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Allman Brothers.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
I don't know.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
You're telling me.
Whose burying ground?
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
It's Ellie's cat.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
And Church will be fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
She.  Goes.  Free.
Elizabeth goes free!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Wait as long as you like.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I can't breathe.
Yes -- yes.
Ceremony?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
-- then we never would have met.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
The trees are taller.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
We're catching up!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I'll be at the wheel myself.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Aye!  Avast!
My father.  William Turner?
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Barbossa.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
I'll lead them away.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
And no lies!
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Please.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
That might work.
The trunk.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
So, I guess it worked.
Same old Daniel.
The big house?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I guess I should be flattered.
That's what I thought.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
What happened to it?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
The waste.
What happens?
That's right.
No, no, I just feel wired!
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't know.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Getting used to it.
On the counter.
The head shrinker at the prison.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
The same thing I suppose.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
I have to!
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
And you have him?
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Yes - Sing Sing.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Certainly. Right over there.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
How-di-do.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Are you crazy?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Your house?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Why—
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Well, I should say!
Yeah?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
Gloria Golden?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Thank you, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Staring at us?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Very good.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure.
Double strength!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
The name is Smythe.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
That's all I wanted to know!
Very good, sir.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
... Sex.
What?
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm sorry ...
Here's my favorite.
Yes she is.
Yeah. It does.
Where are you gonna go?
... Lover's Lane.
So.
Why not?
What's the matter?
One of those ... big beds?
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Very well ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What are you doing?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Neither do I.
We're supposed to be in school.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Really? It seems so fattening.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
... Yeah.
Wow.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Oh ... Right.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
They just grow like that?
We'll just put up the top.
I like it too.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
Right. And how did she dress him?
That's right.
Ooomph?
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Why?
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Just gimme the damn remote!
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
What?
... Yeah.
Forget about that!
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Hey.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
No, no, no.
This is "Fly With Us?"
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm trying to be your friend.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm gonna call you back.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
I....please don't do this.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Are you watching a porno movie?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
Can I ask you a question?
No. I'm sorry.
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Ok.
Sure.
Ok.
Yeah.
No, no. I did.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Yes.
Ok.
...yeah...
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yes.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
yeah.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Can I come home with you when we get there?
You left me at the hospital.
Just have you for one second, please.
Well who did?
Why? ...what?
Why?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
-- and this is confidential?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Hi Walter.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
It takes time to process --
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
You have an ATM?
Are you going to the party tonight?
You can't be late.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
I thought Latisha said you would --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Ok.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
Yes, Abbe?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
-- that was lust --
His wife's influence.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
Shut down?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
And my own.
Poorly.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Is it terribly erotic?
What's that then?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
No. But tell him I would.
I pray you: be succinct.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
What thought is that?
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Of course.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
You've come to lecture me?
But it's just begun --
Not you too
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
I can't
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Over at RKO?
You know that can't happen.
How much?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Sir?
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
I can't remember the lines!
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
No -- no -- I mean--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
I expected more from you.
They don't have to.
And what does he see?
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
George...
Yeah, you're probably right.
Herman.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Yes.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Again.
Ah, it's a grand title.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
What?
And where you goin'?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Here's your glove.
Jack! Enough!
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
What do you mean?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Does that mean...
You sound bitter.
At night?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
It feels real good.
Should I hit it?
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
What did I do?
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I got bored so I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
I am answering...
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Yeah --
OK. Talk.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
He should.
Right, the gym.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Namely?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
All right -- you don't believe me.
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Not yet.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think he's getting out of here?
Your logic is backward.
Like what?
A possibility.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
No.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
I was.
Depends one which one.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And some man will lose his.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
There's something buried there.
Look!
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart girl.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Tired?
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Without any future?
Homework. It's more interesting.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Something too frightful to utter.
Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Too close.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Phone number?
A new disease.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Good luck, Buzz.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You make any sandwiches?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Well, now--
I was in it.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sure.  Sure.
That's right!
Open it.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
I'll wait for him.
No.  In the morning.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Who?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Your father!
Get away from me!
I'm fine.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Good Lord!
Leave me alone.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Mess that kid up?
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Now that's true!
Where what was.
You going there?
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I'm never going back.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Are you?
What?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
What?
What?
I didn't want to stop.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
We're talking, aren't we?
What, he should see me help you catch him?
No, hey, I like your coat --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Your brother...
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Don't say my name...
What?
I don't know...
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You said it a million times!
Wish I had a brother like you.
A station wagon in Canada.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
More than you know.
Put it on.
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Six men means six guns.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name...
Take 'em.
Leave the tree.
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Mr. Bangs.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
Fuckin' freezing.
My what?!
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Oh, man --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Ain't there yet.
Not yet.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
She set them up. All of them.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
You gave them me.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Who?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Nope.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Down to my car.
No, I'm not!
I'm okay.
Joe.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
We can't take him to a hospital.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I don't know anybody.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Yeah, those guys too.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Maybe he did.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Why do you think?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Maybe it's better that way.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
All right -- it's said!
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
I'm sorry.
Maybe they will.
To the other side of the street.
So did I. They were in it.
Hello, Miss Wells.
A little hot.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
That's right, Steve.
I won't again.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You want to split up? --
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
All right, you didn't know.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Yes, people make me restless.
There aren't any women here.
Now where's she goin'? --
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
That's it then.
Everybody knows --
Where is he?
What for?
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Hey, I have an idea...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Hello Ray.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Alright!
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't care. You pick.
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
I don't need your help.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
My child, you're alive!
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Are these all the subjects?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Just a little Rogaine.
That's right.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
It says, "Ray."
"Fucked me."
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Jeeezzz!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
I don't feel like rewinding it!
This is so silly. 
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
...People who don't mind their own business.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
It's not fair!!
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes.
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I did her hair.
Nothing.
She showed me a drawing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Why?
But you have treated me that way.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
We've tried so long to find her.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
We could tell him.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm afraid.
You will die.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
I don't know.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
She was my patient.
I've lost my knack.
Uh—huh.
I should like people to read what I've written.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
You know where she is?
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
Yes?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What did he say?
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
It won't hurt.
Yes?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Impotent.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Basically, yes.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Why not?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes.
I know.
Don't you want to make one?
When we're making love?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
You said you weren't always impotent.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
That's very flattering.
Why not?
No.
Not entirely.
Possibly.
I don't care.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Mmmmm...
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
But I'm not.
You've made your point.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Not very often.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Yeah, I know.
Did you masturbate?
No, I haven't.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Is he still at your house?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Why?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, what, then?
But why did you want to?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I don't want to discuss it.
Did you take your clothes off?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
So will you, someday.
She still is.
What do you get?
Talking.
I just want to ask you questions.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Very much live.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
I can't talk you into it?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Right now.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
What do you mean?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He'll be really mad.
Hi. Want a drink?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
No. I don't think so.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Nick, you're so strange...
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
I don't get it.
Who was she?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
What show?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
YOUNG BLOOD
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
No.
We love you, Baby.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
It'll just take a second.
And?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
I can't help the traffic.
Yeah, Conundrum.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Um... seventy... something.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Huh.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
So you're going to stop acting?
If that's what feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
You know that chick?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Yep.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Understanding of what?
Yeah.
Nope.
Thanks, Jack.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Slaughterhouse.
Put me down, Jack.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't have to.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
What?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No way. No way.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Sure.
I finished it.
I know. I love that.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Yeah, I know.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
"The Day After Yesterday."
A paper?
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Sure.
Goodnight, Miles.
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
This one?
Don't touch him.
I heard them Morgan.
Hi baby.
...I will.
I'm here.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes, it was.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
I got him.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Have they said anything about our area?
Yes.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father.
No.
What did you say?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I'm sorry.
Where's Jake?
Is he alive?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
This is a brutal land.
It's one thing to know it...
How's Mr. Parker doing?
My name is Emmett.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Where's Turley?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
I'm going to California with my brother.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
And a pretty lady.
Believe it.
Why?
We didn't get that far.
He is now.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Really?
I was afraid of that.
I heard that too.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Why'd you go into business with him?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
That was my plan.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
I'm glad we talked.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
I'll send you her resume.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
She said you were very beautiful.
Thank you.
When is she coming over?
Impossible.
No... it's life.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Hello, Hal.
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
How did the wall get there?
-- Please, get away from me.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I'm sorry.
I need flesh and --
I don't know anything about computers.
You saw that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I do.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Precisely.
I noticed.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
It's a yacht.
The background is.
Er,... good.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Long live the First Amendment.
Is that why she left you?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
Thank you.
-- What you don't understand --
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
You use needles?
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
I guess they don't.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
What?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Them?
Yes.
I don't know.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes, I am.
Maybe.
What?
Oh.
Don't get mad.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
...I don't know.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Stop looking at me.
S-ssssstop it!
Meaning?
Chicken blood on the crops.
What's a "little while?"
Nope.
Slut.
Bitch.
Not according to these.
No shit.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
"-- an AXE!"
Harvest moonshining!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I'll be fine here.
I --
What's wrong?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Then why go back now?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Let it go.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Never.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Bill, we need to talk!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Yeah. Good.
Aspirin.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Yeah.
Shut up.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Out.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
What other stuff?
Margaret.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Okay.
Driving?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Eleven.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
You could've asked.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
Weight Station.
Absolutely.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
You sure do.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
See.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Go.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What's your twenty?
Then don't.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Now, you just find him, son.
That's correct.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Ww... uh...
Damn... alright then.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Okay.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- You can and you will.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
I'm here.
-- okay, g'head --
Yeah, I can front this.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
None whatsoever.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What!?
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
All right.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Yes.
Who was it?
Will she come back?
To who?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Not necessarily.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Book?
Rheya.  Not here.
Let's go home.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You don't love me.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Not this time.
I love you.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
I'm disgusting.
Then you'll die.
Thank you.
I can't stay here.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Am I really her?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Can we go then?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Queens... You know Queens?
Beg pardon?
I got money.
I came on at 8:00.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
What do you want?
I can't open it.
Claire...!
Let go!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
... Don't explain.
Yeah.  It's all over.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Nothing.
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
I can still use a gun.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
No.
No, I need'm now!
Right behind you, T.J.
Does it make you... hard?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Is she injured?
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Okay, I guess.
She's taking singing lessons.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Be nice.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No…not really.
Remember Little League?
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Mm-hmm.
Lemme down, bugface!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
What if you get hurt?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
I hate people with alliterative names.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I'd never admit that.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Do you mind if I come too?
I know what you mean.  I...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm here...
Why?
So you've found Thorkel?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Any sign of our friend?
That's the understatement of the year.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
It'll shut itself off.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I don't care.  Cretin.
No!
I will finish what I've begun…
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
No, no!  Not there!
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Coming up.
In this barracks?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Why not?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Sefton!
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Some are not bad at all.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
What do they always say?
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Let me alone.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
A little weak today.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
We did it.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
You did!
What's the decoy?
Shoot!
Just what makes you so popular?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
What did you say?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Here. Take them.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
A chicken?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
He is.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
I believe so.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Commander.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Agreed.
You get what?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
All hands, brace for impact!
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
What happened to you?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
No, no. Thank you.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
You could say that.
Where are the deflector relays?
What's normal?
No, I didn't know that.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
There are no other ships in the system.
Trilithium?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Aye, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
David!... What went wrong?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
None that I can detect, sir.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Sir...?
Aye, sir!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Go, Sulu!
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
Report status!
Torpedoes coming in -- !
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Yes...
... Yes...
Understood, my lord.

They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
And who am I hiding from?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Carol!
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Maybe...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I saw it -- !
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
I see. Helmsman?
I don't know.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Locking phasers on target.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Scotty, let's have it.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
I am understandably curious.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Best we could do in two hours.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Because... there was no way to win.
... No, sir. It has not.
There is no such regulation.
Erased...
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Engage warp engines --
Visual.
Scotty!
Battle stations.
Honors -- hup!
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
... They do, indeed.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Gillian --
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
A moment alone, please.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I suppose they told you that...?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Why's that?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
You've already been that. C'mon.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
... You're very perceptive.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
But Kirk...
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
What is our target in time?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Why not?
Exaggerate.
The hell I can't
The tank will be finished by morning...
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
I will, Admiral.
... Aye sir...?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Aye, sir!
On screen.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
How long, Scotty?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
... Yes?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Just use the keyboard...
That's the ticket, laddie.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
There are caves in those mountains.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I'll be here.
Perhaps, that is true.
Sometimes I do.
No one's ever asked me that before.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
From the mission...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Sir?
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
No children?
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Bag him.
I do not know what you are referring to.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
There should be an access hatch nearby...
There should be some kind of manual release...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Great name. French?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
I have to...
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Fire.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Life signs?
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Agreed. Options?
Right.
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Riker here.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Still think we're finished?
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Barely.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I'm not sure how to take that.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
But if she's cloaked...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
Kill him! He's the one!!
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
What?
Visual!
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
I believe I am.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
No.
No.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
That was another time.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Now, you make a toast.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Fire!
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.

And I you.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Counselor?
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the population?
I'll take care of it, sir.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
That will never happen.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Still well on our side...
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
No?
Yes.
How did you end up on Remus?
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
New worlds.
There is that.
Why am I here?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I won't defend my life to you.
Why are you here?
Long ago.
He is what his life has made him!
But you want to.
Please.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
He's a very unusual android.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Seven minutes.
I came this far alone ...
Praetor.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so... 
Thank you.
How much are your rooms?
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
I understand.
I make maps.
No.
They must have picked it up in space.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
Watch it. They're coming out.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Eh... police.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Smile.
No gas.
Space?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Shit!
Horses.
It was yellow.
No.
Do you have a baby?
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
The car will stop?
I was afraid.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I am your friend.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I do not want to.
Yes. Sing some more.
No. Get in.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Where did you learn that?
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Nothing.
But...
I know how to gamble now.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I will.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
What? No, of course not.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
I did.
No.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Yes.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
I don't understand.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Hey, fuck you, man.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Forget it's there.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
We should talk alone.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Shutup a second!
He records himself raping and killing her--
W'sup, Max?
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Okay... what about Strickland?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Your sex life?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Define illegal.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
She still loves me.
It's not your fault.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Sure.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
You sure?
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
See you downtown.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
That's right, Jan.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Put a BOLO out on that.
What's with the eyelids?
Maybe cause he's smart.
This better be important.
Who?
Then why do I still have a badge?
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
I don't believe this.
"Was?"
How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I was looking for a pattern.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
How long have you been downtown?
It explains a lot.
The other reason?
This is some serious shit.
And one other thing.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Not the way I can.
Does one exist?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
I'll be back.
He's moved on to TV.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Who told you about her?
Those were just fantasies.
Maybe you should back off.
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
What did you do to end up here?
Sounds like fun.
Murman!
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Just like that?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
What else is going on?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
No...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...It's really getting late.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Fine... I guess. You?
I thought you met someone else.
...the Michelin commercial...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
What do you want? You're tall.
Oh no?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What'd you get?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
Go for it, man.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
Well, that's dumb.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Not well.
You asshole.
What are they doing here?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
You're crazy.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Whu?
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Thanks for clarifying that.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
It starts at eight...
Yeah. You met him once.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No, baby!
No...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...Is he brown?
You think?
True.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Be smart about it.
Our little baby's growing up...
Good.  He never doubted you.
I ask for Justice.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
Ba Fa Goulle.
Like hell I will.
No, just you and Paulie.
OK, but be careful.
We gotta move...
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Sure.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
When did he call?
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Barzini.
You wanted me to be your son.
Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
How did you find out?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
No.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
We're all tired...
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
Did he give you his politicians?
How will they come at you?
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Al Capone!
Michael you're trying to scare me...
How do you do.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Let HER ask.
I'm busy.
Don't ask me.
I can help you out...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Until the old man tells me different.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
To the city.
The kid's right.
He talked to you?
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Is that good?
I don't get it.
I don't like you.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Oh, it was.
Yes please!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Sure. I love Venice.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Oh God, I don't think so.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Such as?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
He's not a man, he's a god.
What about Cortina?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Dickie did it.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the...?
How did you know that?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Hello Meredith.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know what -- I am.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiancée...?
Does he stay with you here?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Huh?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Oh. Who was that again?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Yeah.
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
Yeah.
And what happened?
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
You looking for some action?
A girl needs protection.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Huh?
He looks like a killer.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Do I look like a narc?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Why, thank you Travis.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
You want to work uptown nights?
Age?
Education?
Military record?
Why?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
Iris?
Yeah?
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
Now they only have three rockets left.
It's about time.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Well...
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Well... where can we go?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yes.  Hic!
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I'm not refuting anything.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Ben, when's Delly due back?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
By all means.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Good to meet you.  Again.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Harry, son.  Harry.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yes.
No, sir.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I was decorated.
Exactly.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No thanks.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
I taught you that.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
No, I...
What?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Oh.
Oh.
You bet, honey.
What exactly did you hear?
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
The war...
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
No.  Absolutely not.
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
All right. 
How'd you happen to come here?
I suspected as much.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Different?
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
If your father were here...
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I don't know yet.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Try my best.
Right across the bay there.
That's where the Brenners live.
The little Brenner girl?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes, very.
I know, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
You're doing fine.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
Yes.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I don't mind, really.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Monday?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
The sign says strawberry finches.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
His wife changed the channel.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Helping travelers.
I'm glad you do.
What'll it say?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I'll get it.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
So they united.
Hear!
With my little sparrow leading team.
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Don't let's take any chances.
Almost two a.m.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Yes.
Well, all right, but...
How soon?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
How?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Aye.
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I remember her.
I can't believe that.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
Pulse?
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
No.
Why, yes.
He was a nice horse.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
I am the best man for the job.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
We have never been friends.
I have other means of sustenance.
I know --
Yes.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
No great lady will ever take my place?
He must leave me alone.
Where are they? Last chance.
Good thing in a situation like this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Your father gave them to both of you.
No! Why are you haunting me?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Yeah, we do.
I know.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
You mean Alex.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I do. Every day.
Not tonight. Honest.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
I don't believe you.
He'll be there at 8:30.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
Would you care to be more specific?
That's what I came to see you about.
No -- not at all.
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
All right.
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
What about him?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Jittery is the word.
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
I'm sorry.
I'd give you a very good price.
They would have killed this man?
This one could save your life.
You better get some fresh air.
He's my brother.
Zero.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
For a ride.
Yeah.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Okay, okay.
Sam, don't --
Lots more where he came from.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
In here?
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Well, I...
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Because I love you...
Take laddie.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
What would that make Mom?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Yeah.
Anybody sick?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
Finish what?
Watch Clark.
Have you come across Fuchs?
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
The dogs?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Thank you.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
When was the last time you used it?
That far?
What's that?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Everything that's been missing.
Anyplace but here.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
How did you know?!
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Yes.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Oh, shut up.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
A man can change his history.
I know.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
I mean... well... affection.
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know I can't.
I need... to talk to you.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
What?
Perseverance.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I would.
His home.
I don't understand.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
It's undamaged?
So you can use it now?
Do you have it?!
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
We don't know.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
You two ok?
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
Yeah.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
There're no cars on this street.
It's Sunday.
To the hospital.
Ok.
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I could try to...make it stop.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
You have no idea what's going on.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Is it true?
No.
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You girls are in some hot water.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
My Lord.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
Call me back.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
How come he let you go?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Yeah!
Which part?
So this is all my fault, is it.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Thelma kinda took to him.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
What happened?
Yeah.
What for?
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Now what what?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Just ignore him.
We should have just ignored him.
About how fast was I going?
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Hit it.
I believe you.
Are you alright?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What do you mean?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Good.
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck you.
Hi there!  You alright?
Fresno.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Uh-huh.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Mints?
Hm?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Big time.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Am I?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Dumbshit.
Thanks.
Same here again.
I beg your pardon?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Deco.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
You can't be serious.
So you found Mary?
So she's married?
Three different guys?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Your turn?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
How'd you manage that one?
Fucking sickening.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
That must make it tough.
Hm?
What's that supposed to mean?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Huh?
Really? I never got a message.
He's dead.
Hm?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Okay.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
I think a little of both.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
I wasn't trying --
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
What if I can't?
Then you'll call, right?
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Smoke.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Yeah.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Forget it, Scotty.
Dean Rusk!
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
You're sure...
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Jesus Christ...
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Rug samples.
Again. Figures, man.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
What journey?
Good. Thank you.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Who the fuck is he?
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Why?
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
No way, Cooch.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Bullshit.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What you call myths, we call our history.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
What do you mean?
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
That's right. Turn around.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Ray. What's your 20?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
What the fuck you talkin' about?
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
That's all!
Two miles.
Too aggressive?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Evan... or Maverick.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Winston Churchill.
Where?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
That's what I want.
True.
That's three.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Well what?
No sir! But you have to be ready.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
NO. NO GOOD.
BREAKING LEFT!
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
No shit. The Iceman....
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
I've had enough...for now.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
GOT 'EM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
Nope.
Tell me one thing.
Bad?
Yes sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
I'm nothing like him.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Over there man.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Yes, sir.
Don't be an idiot.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Why not?
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Hetero.
Brunette.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Any news of Quaid?
Where?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Oh, Rekall.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Well don't.
Up to the right.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Up!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Quit while you're ahead.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Just think about it.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Doug...
I'm not your wife.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I'm honored.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Bullshit.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I guess he didn't.
There's something I have to tell you...
Hauser left me a note.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
The reactor.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Hell you did.  Your turn.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
You got <u>that</u> right!
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
No ties.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
I have to talk to your brother.
Let go of my hair.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Roger Baron.
...What do you mean?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
EXACTLY!
How can I tell you what I don't know!
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- alleged crime --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Shu's the only one I know of...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Get lost Bobby.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Bobby...
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
Did she ever mention any friends?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
Cole said she was 17.
She's wearing a ring.
You didn't do your homework?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
When?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
If I can smoke it.
Nothing.
No.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
I did? I didn't see anything.
What does Bob say?
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Boating?
Eating?
Trees?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Fish eyes?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Good night, sweetheart.
We're late to get to your mother.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Who am I?
Nothing, I chickened out.
As if I didn't know.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Yes.
How did you settle on the amount?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Yes.
I...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Just as you are, Sir...
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Objection.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
...I was one of a group of...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
Yes!
It was good of you to meet...
There's nothing they can do to me.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Right. Who called?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
...that's perfectly all right.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
I did.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And what are you? A cop?
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I'm sure you do...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Thanks, Franky.
That's for sure, Frank.
Don't touch anything.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Admittance form is wrong.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
The Doctors.
The broad has disappeared...
We, we were rather busy...
Huh. And why is that?
How'm I doing so far?
Come on out!  We're friends!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
It was...  ...one of them!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Chase...
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Like what?
No.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He was just here!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You have a fever, sweetie?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Finish, please!
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Here.
Read me some?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
Your father?
You miss him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Fifteen.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
What?
Congratulations.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I guess.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Fine.
Do what?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
I can't make it out?
All stop on the engine.
Face what?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sir...?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
I know.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Why are you here?
I can take care of myself.
What's that?
They'll know about it in the morning.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
That's enough.
We'll think of something.
I couldn't do it.
Shut up donut.
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You know what he is talking about here?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Outer.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
About anything.
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
No.
I'm not staying out here.
Joy, rapture...
I can't.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
No.  I didn't.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Fuck me.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Ready for another?
She really say she was pregnant?
Forty bucks...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
That's right... Take one of these.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's the name of it?
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
...Asshole.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Here she goes again...
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Yeah?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Who knows, baby?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
What's that?
Let's get outta here, honey.
You sick?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
Uh-huh?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
I'll bet.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Yes... Get rid of him.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
Shoot him.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Santos... I can't...
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
You're welcome.
How are you, Crabtree?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
So what's the problem?
Find the jacket.
Don't touch it.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Call it a hunch.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Excuse me?
It's mine.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Her dog, yes.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Stop calling me Vernon.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
With Emily?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
It's very convincing.
No! What gave you that idea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Is he all right?
You're welcome.
Who?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
But James. I mean... How long?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Glaucoma?
Where's that?
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
That's right. That one.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
In a minute. Get us a table.
No thanks.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
I think so... What about you?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
Oh. Well. I...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
That good, huh?
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Caps.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Inside.
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Oh?
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
James is... I don't know...
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
It's Grady, Walter.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Sick.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
I was thinking of you.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
That's weird.
The perpetrator.
I might have his number on campus.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Something wrong with that?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
How is she?
Huh?
You need a table.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
When?
Isn't it?
You don't have to tell me this.
Birds.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
It's hard to describe.
You live around here?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have friends.
I'm not pretty.
Cop.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
No.
Woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
I was asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
What?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Do you like it when he asks you?
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
Yes?
No way.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
Reflect.
How's that?
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
What did you think would happen?
I want to talk about it now.
I said I was sorry.
I don't see --
Nothing.
Accept you?
Neither do you.
I'll buy a plant.
Yeah, they could.
I get that impression.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
The morning?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I'm not scared.
Live together.
Just think about it.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
What's it look like?
I'm not scared.
Yeah.
Not when they fly.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Your rig?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
What do you think he saw?
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Yeah.  So sue me.
They'll come out after us.
I don't know, look around.
Calm down, Bud.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What's the plan?
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Who then?
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
How many are there?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
How deep?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
What's the timer set for?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
Four or five days.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
At what?
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
That seems to apply to you also...
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
No.
And why do you tell us this only now?
And how do you explain that?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
But then when will we see each other?
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Okay. In a few minutes.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Late, very late.
Better dead.
You say that just to flatter me.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
What do you think?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
We'll try again.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
And where do you find the models?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
You're kidding!
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Why?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Who tells you these things?
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
They were stained.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I don't know... I don't know...
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
In the confessional.
In the middle of all the pain?
Then let's talk about something else...
Anything.
What?
No... do you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
She'd get angry.
A mistake...
Not my fault.
Everything... I don't have children.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
I'm always bad.
She can.
I'm afraid.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
It grew.
No.
She made me promise not to.
I hate them.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Are you ill?
What do you do?
Yes.
Who?
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
Yes.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
When?
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
The one up on the third floor?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
... Thank you.
I haven't a clue.
None as far as I know.
What's your opinion?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
That's ridiculous...
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
About two years before.
What?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I'd like yours too.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
I'd love one.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Hand rolled.
You think she's a saint?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Is it because she's a nun?
Yes.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Bet you're only eight and a half.
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
I've made the scene.
No. I don't.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
But I won't.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
A butcher?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
He's sulking again.
We do.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Is it ... is it, really?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
Lip reading.
What's he on about?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
I'll look after meself.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
He's got you worried, then?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Foreign devil ...
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
He started it.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Oh yes.
What have you heard?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Sorry.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Or something will be able to see us.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
... I don't know...
Dell, plot our location.
Is it solid?
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
But functioning.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it, I can't --
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
God I'm hungry.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
A voice transmission.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Yeah!
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
That way.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Right.
Right.
Poison gas...
Right. 
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
I'll come with you.
What do you mean?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Still unconscious?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
We're not going anywhere.
How many?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Who knows?
Sun will be down in a minute.
Let's let the machine work on him.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Let's get moving with this net.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Look --
That tube must be depositing it in him.
About four hours.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Anything else?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
By eating our food supplies.
So the next step should be --
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Can we get to him?
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Yeah...
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
What's happening?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
What?
How?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Okay.
Auto-shop?
Uh-huh.
What's the problem?
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Well... try the headset.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Check out the tent.
Agreed.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Don't wait for me!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Eddie...
Just some coffee.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Frankly - yes.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
You have no right to say such things!
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
You're being childish.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You were there? At the play - last night?
Margo.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I take it she read well.
How nice.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
Where?
That's nice.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Huh?
Call me when you get in...
Sing it?
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Cut it out.
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Okay. Mix.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
What would you like? Texas?
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
A married lady.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
You didn't have to tell me.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
From what would I be running?
I'm for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
No thanks, Birdie.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
But she just got here...
What did you expect - live sables?
Buy some.
Oh, brother.
See you home...
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Now you want an argument.
What report? To whom?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Subway.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
I don't care if I never get home.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Try...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
The heave-ho.
Harrington.
Three or four miles...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Isn't that what they always say?
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Well... all right.
With tears.
Check.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
With gestures, of course.
Now just a minute!
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
I will.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
How do you mean?
She was a revelation...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Too bad.
What's your being married got to do with it?
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Would you?
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I was sure trying.
--a spy, you mean?
The fucking New York Times.
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
--you do?--with access to records?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
You're not a kid anymore.
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--Haldeman I know, who else?
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--Howard Hunt?
Well of course.
--so?
We've just been talking to Young--
And?--
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
To cover up?
I will not talk about the other two.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
How senior?
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
--I'm not here.
I have nothing more to say.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
I think so.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Absolutely.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
No, none of those.
The what to what?
Sure.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yep.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
I don't get it, that really works?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
He's going in!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
Okay!
So do I, Kev.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Move with the music.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin, this is serious!
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Qualify for what?
What's that?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Observe.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Keep it down, dude.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Just like sex with my wife.
But you better hurry.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Serafine...?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
It's okay. I can see fine.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
And you call me a moron...
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Looks like he lied to you too.
Oh shit... No...
Yeah?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Sort of...
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
You fucking liar!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Who's Sophie?
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
What happened to your parents?
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Why?
Trying... to... breathe...
It's not you - it's the dress!
Sad?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Is it? Is this what you want?
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
No. Empress, you --
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Come on.
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Hey, that was last year.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
You-you play... very well.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Okay.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
It's terrific.
What?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
I didn't follow you!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
What... huh?
Oh! My God! 
Thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Nothing at all?
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I'm late.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I can't.
You have a raccoon?
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
Key word here is "indulgent."
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Look, uh...
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
And... uh-
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
His wife has diabetes!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
...of possibly working together.
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
I was very charming.
A long time.
It's the way they do things.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
One guess.
I'm not that good.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
It's alright, isn't it?
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
It's not going to come up.
Don't you miss it?
I love her too, Joe.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
When does he graduate high school?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
She left a note.
Monica.
We live next door.
Nice to meet you.
Forget it, Judy.
A perfect night.
Not as a rule.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
I'm going to throw up.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Truce?
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
He'll find his way back.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
I guess.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Oh, you know, I am.
Sure.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I'm sorry.
That's a lot of those.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
He always has two or three going...
You're not serious.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Are you working on a new book?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Yes.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Yeah.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I wasn't finished.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
I don't want to talk about it.
I never like to talk about my work.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
I don't mind...
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
So how much do you hate her?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Hlllllllp!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
A <u>few</u>?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Superior numbers, kid!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
I...I have no idea, sir.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
Why are we so successful?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
You're a real buddy.
What do I do?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Yeah.  How much?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Under the mat? 
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Sheldrake?
Oh!
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
How is your cold?
How come?
Oh.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Two o'clock.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Baxter.
Miss. 
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Give what up?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
I'm fine.
Seven --  -- queen.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Gas?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You better.
Yes, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Swap them? For what?
Relax, Baxter.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Mine?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
So what's it going to be?
No I didn't.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
I have a vague idea.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Happy New Year.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
I don't know.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Let me take that.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Handle what?
I promise.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Don't you ever stop talking?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
It won't happen again.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
We need all our fuel.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
Cook school -- that did it.
God knows.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Too far inland.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
A lame ?
But why ?
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Who?
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'm taking you back.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
What?
Yeah... thanks.
Sure.
Why?
And shut up.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Right now -- I am.
I do.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
23   CONTINUED:  
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
139  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
26   CONTINUED:  
She's dead.
I don't want to talk any more.
-- Corbett's a killer.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
-- Permanently?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
I'm right behind you.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Shut up!
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
Any idea who could've done it?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
You all set here?
Carol the waitress?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Yes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I want you to go on this trip.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
You take off when you have to.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Never.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
All right, cut me a break.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
He's a pain in the ass.
Do it.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
'Love was... '
Well, that's a load off.
Okay, then.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
This stuff is pointless.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
What are you talking about?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Absolutely not.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Just a second -- he has to go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Where?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
We both know what you were doing.
Tachlinkov.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
What?
You're too late.
What?
Sick.  The flu.
The contract was stolen.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
I bet you fucking know!
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
One hour per man.
Yeah.
'Them'?
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
We don't have a choice.
Where you wanted to be?
You were like a boy genius?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
Then you went freelance?
Tell me about the first time.
Did it ever bother you?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Where is it?
I don't know.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
What?
No.
Why?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Are you attracted to me?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Honestly?
I'm not normal.
What?
Okay.
Yes.
Electra --
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
All the time.
Sure.
Why not?
I hope not.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
American currency.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Like you?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
That makes you an expert I guess.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Thought of everything haven't you.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, I'll take some.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
They'll never get us.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
What?
You capitalist pig!
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Some deal you did there!
Here!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
No!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Really?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
Whatever!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I hope so!
But I love you!
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Ah, so what?
What for?
Am I invited?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
Fuck you!
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Just yesterday.
Maybe it is!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Later.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Some Americans?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
Very well.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Me neither.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
I didn't know either.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
You do --
Scamming's a strong word.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Good thing.
It's private.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
And you have to meet my father.
Don't bother!
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
In ten words or less?
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What?
No.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Twice a year.
What would you do up here?
I was twelve.
Mars.
Me.
Yes, one of many.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
Anything you want.
I used to like yogurt.
I'm not going back to school.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Yes.
He wants help with his lines --
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
No.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
No.
Like what, sir?
Either. Both.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
Yes. You?
I'm no dummy.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
I'd work backstage or something?
Scalene?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Oh yeah.
Poly-what?
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Well... yeah...
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Not a holocaust --
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Run out of gas?
Pro! Release the rope!
...To be traveled through
Why?
Marty.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
The power converter...
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You did what?!?
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
What do you call this? 
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
I run this place! 
No way!
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Yeah.
Not bad.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Tom...
No.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
Great.
I don't know.
Well, I got homework.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah.
Don't ask me.
How bad off is he?
Just looking.
Yeah.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Positive?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I just don't want to go.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Just thinking.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Who're you?
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
The door's locked.
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Asshole probably got lost.
Flying to Cambodia.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
How about you? Will you be alright?
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Hah!
...Who is this?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
Ever act?
Who?
To do what?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
See you, Charlie.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
You gotta believe me –
We gotta call the police –
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Lou.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Huh?
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Anyway.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Only fry you once.
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
It's been three months.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
I have nothing to hide.
No.
That's right.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Didn't you study it in school?
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
You can make a mistake.
What if I call you Nicky?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
What's it about?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
She's seen everything before.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Fine.  How's your back?
Did you like her to watch?
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I never have before.
No?
When?
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
Did you miss me?
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
He was murdered.
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
What is it you got between you?
I feel fine!
Why the hell not?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Is he dead?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Are you vice?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Did you check all four years?
Can you check again?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
What's wrong?
I don't like beer.
I know.
Decipher?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Really?
Out?
What's wrong with you today?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
It's Monday morning.
Well thanks!
You mean babies with you?
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
Me? Why?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Wanna Mac?
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
A what?
Yeah.
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
No, actually I feel worse.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
We do.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Have we?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Weird, huh?
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
It does to me.
One way to find out?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Yes?
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
You'd be surprised.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Surf's up.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Just the beast.
She knows who we are.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Can I get some help over here?
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
You lie!
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Then you never loved me?
Our work?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
What did you say?
He ran away?
The _Rolls_?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Tonight's a good night.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
That's usually my line.
What? This isn't normal?
What?
I'm not-
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
WHAT?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Annie, it's me.
Right first time.
Night.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ahm....
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
What makes you say that?
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Yes?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Okay.....
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
And Boot-Head.
Yeah, we should party.
Me first?
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
You mean there's mre than one?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Ah, the witness?
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Uh, ten uh...
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
I am sitting.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
That's how long you were gone.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Of course I did.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
He might have hurt somebody.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
All right.
Is this like a trick question?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
Really.  I don't know.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
We're...
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Our cemetery?
About what?
No, wait!
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Are you a spirit too?
I want to get in.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yeah.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Good girrrl!
That's it!
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Attic space.
Look at the tiny figures.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Oh, fine.
Yes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Thank you.
No.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
... But he's...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like it here.
I am a very good gardener.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Our greenhouse.
Yes, so do we.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
I see.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I like to watch.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes. I like that name very much.
... I see.
Yes. I am very hungry.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
I see, Ben.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
No.
No. I don't object.
Which view?
Thank you.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
No.
Compensated...?
I was given meals, and a home...
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
But you won't sign, correct?
... Hello.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Hello, Sophie.
It's not that, I just...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Okay.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hi.
What?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Let me try.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
I am a trained performer.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
You're insane.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
You married?
My tits?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
No.
It better be.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Hush, sweetheart.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I like that.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Do you?
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I have to see you.
One hour.
Did you see the reviews?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Whatever.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
Was a time I knew what was.
You remember Halle.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
I will.
May I come in?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
Well, what can you do?
Extra?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
That was fun.
No, let her rest.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Morning, ma'am.
You sure?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
I run him off.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
It ain't what you think.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Paul D.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
I'm going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
That fucking bitch!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
No--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Far out.
Nancy's pretty good.
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And what do you do, sir?
And the, uh, the briefcase?
I thought you might know, man.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
What?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
What the fuck are you--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
What the fuck is going on there?
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Dude--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
...Us? DUDE
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
A world of pain.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
I don't think so.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
I don't like it.
I'll show you.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
For what?
Human?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Two so far.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Watch me.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
What are you talking about?
For them. But for me --
You're a week early.
I don't believe that.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
No problem.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
You.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Get away from him!
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
--which she may have--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Let's talk to your husband--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--Christ almighty--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Oh, sorry, right.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
It's like traveling back in time.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
What is <u>this</u>?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You feel no need to get married or anything.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--Cotter's--
No.
Whatever you want.
I can't.
Sometimes.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--go!
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Ask me what I don't have.
Yeah?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you doing with all this shit?
--coming out of the water--
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
No idea--goddamitt!
--I don't know.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--a Wiccan--
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
--shit!!!
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Ah, Domini?
Then I have no idea.
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's why she kills children.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
She's off her fucking rocker--
You're needed here--keep watching--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes.
It won't?
No, I--
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
...You ever get tired?
I don't know. I better get off now.
Yeah.
...What do you mean?
We don't seem to be communicating--
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
See, I never knew that.
...Hell.
How long did you watch her?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
It's not strictly legal.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
How would I know?
For what?
Tuesday.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No. not at all.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
. my bourbon.
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
No. Come on.
See my nipples?
No. What is happening?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm doing it.
Yes.
Just get outta my bed.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I want you to stay with me.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Terrible. boring.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
Why not?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Bye.
Yes.
That's what I thought.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You like mysteries that much?
What is it?
I can't dance fast.
Frank!!
Hey Jeff.
uh uh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Okay.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
What is?
You happy, baby?
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
It's your grass.
We want some grass.
It's your grass.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
I heard.
What?
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Now do you see what I am saying?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Allo?
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
What?
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
It's beautiful.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yeah, well...
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Tough spot.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.

Tuna.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Better than you.
Dad.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
I'll be here.
You swear?
Yes, I do.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Sid Ahmed.
Second district ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Let's try ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Good evening, sir.
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Cause?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Back off, John.
You get his statement?
I have.
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No.
No.
Oriental medicine.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Yes.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
Yes.
A.M -- or P.M.?
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
You know I can't talk about that.
Sorry.
Yes.
No pain, no gain?
I thought the subject was sex?
Yes.
Hi.  It's Frank.
It's okay.
Yeah.
What would?
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Are you scared?
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
She allegedly humped him to death?
Yeah.
Mr. Roston?
You better.  Please answer the question.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
I'm not.
Talk to me.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
No treasure maps, huh?
No. You can have them.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Michael.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Was this during Betty?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No, what?
They got heat in Michigan.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Oh! You caught me.
Must be nice having kids.
And clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Yeah. See you later.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
No. I can't. Not yet.
Are you hungry?
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Nobody's asking you to.
Because I already tried once.
I had a temper.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Then he can move! People move!
Yeah. It could get better.
But now that you have it -
Sure.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
Hmm?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
I don't remember!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
WHAT!
So what the hell's the good news?
Just some flies.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Damned if I know.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
We met.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
I manage them.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You were just a kid.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Now you.
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Potential toxic dump site.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
That building?
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
I think you're fucking crazy!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Yeah, I know.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What the fuck is going on?
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The money?  The money's gone.
But it could be anywhere.
No.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
What?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
He can't kill you --
I had to.  You made me.
Shut up!
Good boy.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Oh, right.
Go right ahead, sir.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, that's it.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Good guess.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Shit, here we go.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Mickey?
Do you think you know me like that?
He hung it up.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
An accident.
He won't.
Not Caesar.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
You're asking me a direct question?
I thought you were never going to do that.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
...which one are you?...
...they won't let you go...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Thanks.
Did you?

-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I won't hurt you.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Go back to the hotel.

I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
xxxxxx
-- he accessed the account --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
All of them?
<u>Where am I</u>?
How did I get here?
I won't forget this.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
I fixed it myself.
...elephoned sir.
Machines don't fix themselves.
...aven't you?
...Yer nostril?
What do I have to do.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Beginner's luck.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
No, no ... I did that...
Er, I knew you looked different.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Am I?
You killed him?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
We don't make mistakes.
I do. Goodbye. 
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Where are you taking me?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
Really.
Every day?
What?
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Stop it ... damn you!
Go away.
No you're not!
Are you sure?
Don't worry.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Next of kin!
I delivered it.
Sam Lowry.
This is your dream girl, is it?
This isn't rare!
Mother!
Mistake?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Numero, trois.
Fixed itself.
What is it?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. Wait here.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Pregnant.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
We are virgins.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Mary said you might be coming.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Ten-four, hon.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
John, play the Sinatra.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
How is she?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
You asked me not to come.
Because you can barely walk.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
What's wrong.
That's too many.
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
A medical miracle.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
How's he doing?
What do you want to break?
Why?
No shit.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You're burned out.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
He's drunk.
You really think so?
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You've made my dreams silly.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don't like the word gay.
We can cut back at the end.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
As good as humanly possible.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
You too.
No.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
This isn't friendship.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Move away from me.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
What is she shooting?
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll speak to you soon
Yes, there is.
Yes.
Yes?
Bobbie, please.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Nobody else had it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Oh.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Honey?...
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
It's not.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
So great -- right?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
How's it going?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
Who?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
How can you say that to me?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Then you should stay here.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
What, right now?
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
I already told you I'm not.
Um...
You're breaking my concentration!
Anything new?
Righto.
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Me too.
Oh...
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
There there...
Yes Walter.
Every word...
Thank you.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Forget it.
Just about anything, Walter.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I'm totally serious!
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Why not?
I know.
Didn't you hear him?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat?
I didn't mean to.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Uh, hi.
Uh, sure.
Huh?!!!
C-connection?
Smack?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You are?
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Good morning Walter!
Here here!
Really?
T-turned on?
Gee.  Thanks.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
If you see him.
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
Let's move out!
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
We hate you guys!
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Hi, guys.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
You were having a nightmare.
Hi.
I am so sure.
Buffy.
Water.  Okay.
Not exactly.
I'll back that up.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Yes.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
It's true.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
They were vampires?
Try to pay attention.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Not if you're careful.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
That's the plan.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Sorry.
What's happening?  What do you want?
My parents have money...
Really?
I'm just a girl.
Does Jeffrey know?
Nice much.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Right.
I don't think so.
Run.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
That's great!
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
He's a virgin.
Yep.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I want to be had.
I want you desperately!
I'm ready for a complicated man.
You okay?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I heard already.
Yeah...you a witch?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
He'll learn.
Oh let's not...
You need a nickname.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Who's he play for?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me!
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
You been in the Majors?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
C ' mon!
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
We'll be praying for you.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
We're getting married.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Jim looking for somebody.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
...he did what he was told.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
Hello.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
They payin'?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Then he called me a faggot.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
...to me.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
No, I'm not okay.
Well...
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
I'll come by.
And they were usually right.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Ace, listen to me.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
No. Just stop everything.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Call security.
What is it?
Right away. Okay?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Hey, Mitch.
Good luck.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I don't need one.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Mm-hm.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You're not takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
What'd you have?
What if he won't stop?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I should have -
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I wouldn't do that...
I'm not -
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
A record of the arrests...
God! 
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I didn't give 'em the m-
You shut up.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Hi. Good.
He won't...
I understand.
I can't.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Okay.
Now move along.
Here we go!
Great!
What?
No. I ain't see anything like that.
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Mm.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Nothin'.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
You did. You're right.
Is that what you want?
It's what you want?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
Okay, yeah.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
Come on! 
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
No, Lester.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
He called you right here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
No, I'm gonna drive.
Are they out now?
All right.
All right.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
So are we.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Yeah.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Charlie M.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
You sure?
Yeah.
Denying?
Mr. Chairman -
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
This looks promising...
In women?
Guilty. I am.
You're probably right.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Winning.
Even the skylight?
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I still have one left...
Spear.
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
Men, huh?
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
Stop.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Enough.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
What did--?
Actually, yes.
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Or relieve me of it later.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
No -- nothing.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
Pictures.
That's not her.
She's gone --
The City National on San Vincente.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
They put their hands all over me.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
You could've hit me.
259-7881.
The money, Nels ... ?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
That's not good enough.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Keep talking.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Talk to the man.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Put the girl on.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Hold on.
Government business?
Then why doesn't she?
How?
She's not a girl, Col --
Nice.
What do you think his name is?
I would expect he does.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
No.
He's Scottish, Col.
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Must be.
Yes...
Is this an obsession of yours?
Something I heard someone say once.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Where?
What you doing here?
Give it over, Dil --
You mean that?
You think that's wise?
I know that.
Ask to meet me again.
When?
A little.
Why, honey --
You following me?
I'm not sure.
More than that.
No. Sit down.
What?
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
Don't go like that.
No.
I suppose I tried.
He asked me to see were you all right.
I like you, DIl
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
Yeah.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Fergus.
Don't call me that --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Horny bastard.
Suits you.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what happens then?
You may be right.
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I told him.
I'm sure.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
Just a girl.
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No. It's the truth.
Could you?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
Don't I know it.
You could have said no.
Why did you sign up?
The fastest.
I'll bear that in mind.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
If they kill me --
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I don't know her.
Stop it --
How can I?
Tell me something, anything.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
What about it?
It's all right -- look.
How do you think I got here?
Open up.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
I love you, Adam.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
With whom? Where?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
You lied to me so many times --
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
No thanks.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
But --
Were you followed?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Yes, but we're divorced.
There must be some way.
Come here.
Reggie -- listen to me --
There, you said it.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
That sounds like their problem.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
No.
Why?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
I dare you.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well!
Go on.
What do you mean?
How much is it worth?
What's its value today?
And the last one?
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Not unless we're blind.
What do you want?
Stop it!
But his mother --
He didn't have one.
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
I wish you wouldn't.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
What should we give him?
We won! We won!
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Quitter.
Yes.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
How do you know?
Charles is.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
How about once more around the park?
What?
Good night.
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
I believe what he said.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Va jouer, mon ange.
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Oh la vache!
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Who invited you?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
It can't be.
No. I'll handle this.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She just turned off her light.
This will relax her.
You know where I can find her?
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
What party?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
No.
I'm fine.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
Who were they?
The principal?
Are you Jody?
His mother's side.
I got to go.
They're tasty.
No, you keep one.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
It doesn't hurt.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Maybe.
What is it?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
Jake, listen.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
No?
And why's that?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Well yes.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
A check?
I was grateful.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Oh.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
No.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Doing what?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
You didn't tell me.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
...no...
She's my sister and my daughter!
Where can we go?
With us.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Okay.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
I'm sorry, I --
Yes...
Yes?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Sure you do.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah, I'll do that.
He was expecting you?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
But that's what you told your wife.
I'm working for his daughter.
She ran away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Come in, Alfredo.
That's right, Modern Times.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
No...
So what's that got to do with it?
OK...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
What does it say there?
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Who said anything about brooms?
Yes.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Hello, Bernstein.
There is no news big enough.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Of course.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
You're no Venus de Milo.
Thanks.
You really don't know who I am?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Half past eleven.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Susan, it seems to me -
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
You can't.
Can you prove it isn't?
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Yes, sir.
Can't say, sir.
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Good.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
That's the train with all the lights.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Was he in love?
Yes.
That must have been love.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Good!
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
How long have you been a smoker?
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.

Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
Awww. That was so cute.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
No, don't!
Dante. You've got a customer.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
No, you're not really getting married?
But you were.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
But can we date?
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
What about Sing?
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Like what?
What time was this?
Nobody. It was closed.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Excuse me?
I'll assess all I want!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Are you open?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Blasphemy.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.

And the second time around...?
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
All of them.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
We're not playing in the street.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
No, you're not.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Bible truth.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
What, your dick?
You want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Fuck you.
What are you talking about?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You need a ride?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Yes.
I know I can bench more than that!
I'm her sister.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I'm not dealing.
One seventy-nine.
A half hour.
I should start.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
I'm serious...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
What time do you get finished?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's your cousin?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
That's tight. Solid.
That's sick, Dante.
You'll be missed.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
He didn't ask me to...
Twenty bucks.
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
I copy.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Hey, fuck you.
My pleasure.
Give him the money.
Nice and easy...
Just hangin' out.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
Hal knows what he's doing.
He can handle it.
I only came back for you.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
How far?
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
There is.
What are you talking about?
It looks like a winding route.
Half a day.
Where's the rest of the team?
Let's move your ass in there!!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Try the wine!
No. She's dead!
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help me, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
How do you do, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
I did, sir.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
You wanna be sick?
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Vitamins will it be then?
Yes!!!
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
I just say what the other person would say?
Yes.
Good. I'm glad
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Four in this block, sir.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Bottega.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
How often you go?
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
In my office?
Jesus...
Of course.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
So?  It was a random thing.
Oh?
Elvis?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Try?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Who the hell is this?
Who is this?
Oh.  Sorry.
Twenty-four minutes.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Max.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Two...
What?
I think so.
Tonight it is.
Play music.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Why?
I need the job.
I don't understand...
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
I don't get it.
Why?
No.
One more.
You're full of shit.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Answer the question.
Slow down.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Just drop me off.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You bit someone's nose off?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Six months.  Eleven days.
What is it with you and the space program?
I have no idea.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Surprise me.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
A water main broke.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Thanks.
Did you kill him?
Where were you the day he died?
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Because he believed me.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
You knew just what I was there for.
That's great.  Good for you.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
I don't know...
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
And what did I say?
Working.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
What the hell does that mean?
Wait --
I was just thinking that.
Wasn't my idea.
Your call.  Have a good night.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
I don't think so.
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Tell me.
So?
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Ellie.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
What would you have me say, David?
Thank you?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Well --
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
It's beautiful.
It's a civilian facility.
You want to classify prime numbers?
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Many others.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That's my girl...  Lights.
That's my girl.  Done.
It's so... small.
That's what they all say.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Ellie --
Peter.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Can you try?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
You're willing to die for this.
What'd you think?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
It's getting late...
It's late.  We should go back.
Thank you.
I can't do this --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
-- I don't know --
It was quite a page turner.
I do.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words.
Meaning...
Git your shovel and git to work.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
We work down in the ditch?
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
That's good: he earned it.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I don't know, Boss.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
She's got him! You hear that?
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Borrowin'.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
What happened? How far did you get?
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
What for?
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We got it locked in the sock.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Forty-five.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
No. No chains either.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
What pattern was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
You know where.
You're calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
How do you know that?
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
That's no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Let me get a little action started here.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
What else?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Tell it to your shrink.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Yessir.
You're damn right I do.
Helen Hudson...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Give me Ruben back...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
You should have gone to the funeral.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Hard to say.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Yeah, and a dimple.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
I'd have to see it on.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Truly.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
I know.    I know.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
There's a spider in my room.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Anything interesting.
It's magic.
Exactly.
Really?    Me too.
No way.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
Your family just met me.
So, it's over?
No, I need some serious household advice.
I better make a list.
Open up.    I want to see.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Really?
Are you OK?
Michael, take it easy.
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
I think we need to talk about some things.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
So, what do you say, Let?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No...
I love him.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
I'll float you.
Do you know who this is?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're calling me on is phone?
Uh, yeah.
What?
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
I'm not here to negotiate.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
How about if I call you?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
What'd you get?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You better.
Man, I can get anything.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hard to say.
Okay boss.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Uh huh.
Oh, you think?
Glenmorangie.
The lucky ones.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I do as I please.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Don't bother.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Jen!
Give it back.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Fine.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
But don't be too lenient.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Who ever made that.
No onions?
Annie, I need a file.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
It can't rain all the time.
Who?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I think he's yours, now.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Is he inside?
"Our" Crow...?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
On my mother's life.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You talking to me?
What? Another letter from your friend?
Refreshing.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
No thank you.
I have feelings for you.
That's not fair.
I think that's for the best.
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you saying?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Schwarz. Jewish?
- none taken -
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Something awful happened last night.
I don't know.
I did?
You think he'll like it?
Just taking your photo.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I know.
Same time next week?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
I told you to lock the door.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
It's Kathryn.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Be more specific.
Even there?
Okay.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
I'm aware.
Yippy.
Yeah.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
So what went wrong?
Where'd she go?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
And that's why you're leaving?
No, I'm not.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I've never done this before.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
I think you have your answer.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
I'll do that.
Annette! Annette!
I did?
Excuse me?
I'd love to.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
What do you mean?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
At the old house with the voice.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
It's early yet.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I'm never unfair.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I'll show you.
It was just a voice.
Voices from an old dark house!
Yes, Amy?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Yes, darling.
Whenever you want.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
A princess?
That's a fine-looking ring.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
No, thank you.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
No, it was another woman.
Does she have PMS?
No it's mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
And my bra finally fits again.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I still thought it was a purse.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
About Mark? Carlton?
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Starving.
Well, whattdaya think?
Yes I do have to pee!
No.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Okay, you busted me.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. I was doing my laundry.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
What's that supposed to mean?
Interesting possibility.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Worse than this?
Okay.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Packages of money.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes.  This way.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Good.
Why, yes.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
What?
What is that door?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
But I...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
That's what people keep telling me.
Well...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
I'm nothing then.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
And we're going away for a holiday.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
Great.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Like how?
What do you mean, he's clean?
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Clean.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Oh.  Excuse me.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Bob...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
The government
That'd be great.
In the car?
Fine.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Why?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Oh... Thanks.
Fertility beads.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
We'd like to hire you.
Of course.
What about it?
No... They don't kid.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I don't know.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Oh... Okay.
You have a lot of secrets.
I run a temp agency.
I know.
It was inspirational.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
It's nice.
... Me, too.
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
What about the intro?
All set.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
The tunnel.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
What is it if it ain't a curse?
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Ain't no place safe.
The hospital? 
Maybe.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
You are dying, too.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
I don't think they're in school.
Women swoon!
I'll tell you later.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Garden?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Doing fine, sir.
It's Nuwanda.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
It's better than doing nothing.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Are you going with Chet?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Yawp!
A crazy madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
That's miles.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Todd Anderson.
My brother went here.
I'll take him over mine.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
It's my birthday.
Oh. 
Yea, art thou there?
Do you have to quit the play?
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
And where is our point of arrival?
Which question is that?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
You hear that?
You people...rich people...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
Not like him.
Yeah...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
A passenger...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Nothing.
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
John...
She fucked me.
Yeah.
Fuckin' A!
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
I know! I fuckin' know!
She does not!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
You mean...?
But I insist.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
I came to see Merle.
Linda, yeah.
You know a guy named Merle?
Sal's alive???
Oh... You know...
I don't know! I don't know either!
Sure.
Right here.
I don't know.
Playing.
Right here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
From Nam?
Hell no!
You got it.
Forget Sal?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
No!!!?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Listen, Nick --
I gotta get back, Nick.
Yeah.
Phantom Mary?
Yeah!
No.
Sure.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Technothugs?
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Wade's here.
Avon Lady!
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
We have to talk.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Telephone repairman.
Fine.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Drop it.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Yes, sir.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Simulated one.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
Not too good.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Take a look at this.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Of course I will.
It hasn't opened yet?
Young man -- you got me there.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
I did not, Grandma.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Sure am.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
No, Stone!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
The seventh day of April --
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Never!
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Well, I --
Shall we?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Why not -- ?
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
I'll never get my washing done.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
It shows on your face.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I won't forget.
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
You can talk to me ...
So, why didn't you come?
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Okay.
I'm a cop from New York.
I told you...
When you're hot, you're hot.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Sure.  Follow me.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Don't I always?
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Thanks...partner.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Roy?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Okay.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Heidi, I'm dying.
Don't call yourself fat.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah... I know.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
What trip?
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
You're crazy.
I like that... yeah!
Look... who's on the phone?
Oh no!
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I can't talk to him.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
What are you doin' in there?
They're okay.
I'm not alone.
Call me whatever you want.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
... armed robbery ...
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I took too long.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Why not?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
I'm glad it's okay.
No, not until after they killed him.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
You're serious!
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
What?
Dead or alive?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Does that still go?
Wyoming.
Everybody!  Back here!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
They're beautiful ...
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
No!
Doing what?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
<i>He killed two children.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
No. Please enlighten me.
PROVE IT!
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Stop it.
I said stop it.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
He said... take his right arm.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
You got my back.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Did you ask Sal?
So, in other words, you are not down.
Jade, I still love you.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
You're welcome.
Gotta go.
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
What makes Sammy run?
I'm working.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yo, I'm gone.
Stop tripping.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Fuck!  My money!
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Talk to your son.
Tonight, when we close.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later.
Keep dreaming.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
We're outta here.
I understand.
Forget it, Mookie.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
You listening to me?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Tell Pino.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
I'll tell you why!
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Yeah...
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Right.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Probably because we've never met.
Cool.
You're it.
The principal.
You brave soldier.
Peg leg?
Shut up!
You're not my real dad.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
And he invented fire.
They can't be real.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
And my mouph is frozen.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Shut up!
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Yes.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
No. What happened?
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
And with that complete loser
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Not to expect you tonight.
You're just jealous.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Oh, go on.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Skateboard.
That's the downside. There is none.
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Yes!
What?
Love it!
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
With your permission...
Yes.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Paul!!  Paul!!
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Yes...
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I have no next picture.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Ah, so I pull the strings!
I am always on time.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
I never said I could ad-lib...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
You mean a Tesla coil?
Rolling.
This is kind of a stream--
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
What?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Better than not getting a job?
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Toss us out on our ass.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Are you a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh.  My condolences.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Huh?
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
What's uncanny?
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
NOOOOO!!!
Who?
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Come on...
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
What?
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Excuse me.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
This guy.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Oh my God!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
The doctor said you were having sex.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Dynamite.
Okay ...
Really?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Why?
... yeah, then, but...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
No. It's your fault.
What?
Everybody's someone.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What do we have to do?
What?
What is?!
We're excited.
No. What happened?
What's the dif --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
Please!
Yeah.
Cassie...
Ray, come an--
Me?!
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
No problema.  You want a picture?
What...
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Ed... I'm sorry.
Hi.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Good?
pierdo.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
What kind of person?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Thanks, Mr. M.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
Take as much room as you want
You will.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
This weekend.
Door was open.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Okay, let's say
What?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Till 19-fucking-70.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Are you sorry she's dead?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Yeah.  But not for long.
So tell me about it.
Call me Dudley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
You've got it, Wendell.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
What was that boyfriend's name?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I'm not asking you.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Against your code?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Clean?
Until he gunned down six people.
I don't have time.  I have --
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Man, what're you saying?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
And now you'll provide them.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
What?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
What?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Bud White's been here?
What's her name?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Some reality.
Why not?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Under the house.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Sid, how are they hanging?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
I just called it.
And no one'll know about this?
Oh Jesus.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Turn on CNN.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Why?
I don't know who he is.
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
Yeah.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
Look, my wife is understandably--
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
How do you know so much?
Who?
Where?
<u>Here</u>?!
Why?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
C'mon.
Not particularly, no.
What are you saying?
Oh my God.
With what?
Yes. I have her permission.
Thanks.
Okay.
The robbery.
A report?
About what?
Somebody took my blender.
No.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
No.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Was that doctored-up, too?
Well...yeah.
You opened the thing?
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
It tastes like fish.
Other than me.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
You got a minute?
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
It's not me?
We believe he did.
We'd rather not--
You're firing me.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Why?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Dad!
Alright!
Bobby--
Bobby--
Bobby--
To the cops?
No. No, it's okay.
Jerry?
Are you still in Crystal City?
The police?
I honestly don't know.
I don't know.
Why not?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
I just meant--
Dean's with Lyle.
Do you have visual?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Hello!  Good morning.
What do you mean, poetry?
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
No.
Oh my God, the others!
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
No, but I think I do.
I believe you still have my book.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Still a car.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
You too.  Good luck!
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Sorry, what's your point?
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Her hands and feet were tied.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
In my room.
Right.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I liberated it.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Moose.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
What?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
Is something funny?
I've met you before.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Of course.  When?
Kip… I -
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
No.  He's - no.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
A bit of one.
I'm feeling old.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Go away.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Through a window.
Bingo.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
We're getting close.
Too late now.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Uh. I'm showing off.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Well, no...but...
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
You can't.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Not a word.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
We go underwater?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
No. It's a down payment.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Let's just see how we do.
It was a long time ago.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
It's---beautiful.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
In eye of that painting.
Ready.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
A billion dollars.
Everything.
Transfer.
A parting gift from the Empire.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Can't be too careful.
Charged.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
They drive so recklessly there.
I'm not leaving without you.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Which is--
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Because I never assume anything.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Remind me why.
Check out my ball.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You're giving them to me?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
So you say.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
You're a lawyer?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
For what?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Course I did.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Uh-huh.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Yesterday.
Corey.
What do you mean?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
I guess I did.
There's more than one kind?
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Well I hate it.
We'll see.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
I'm gonna clean it up.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
How would you know?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Lock the door.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
That is not what I'm --
I need it.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Uh-huh?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Yes?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You won't.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Okay, okay.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
You know the Jedi Master?
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Then I'll see you in Hell.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sit down, and shut up!
I'm going to see what it is.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I take it back.
Good.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Can you trust him?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Hyperdrive.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
I didn't say anything?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
What is it?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Closer?!
Oh my, no!
What did you say?!
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Why not me?
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
If it must be.  Yes.
No!
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Go on now. Do as I say.
What?
Don't lie to me.
Dream on, blue eye.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Lock fuel rods.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Don't like it, don't come.
Which way?
What the hell is this?
Thank God.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Of Merlin?
What's this, what's this?!
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Your mother told you that?
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
Love demands it.
We are to blame.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
That I cannot.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You didn't ask!
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I see, your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Oh great, anything else?
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Me too.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Really? wow.
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What!
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
And those lies she's been telling?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Please go away.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
He didn't mention her.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
No.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
In Europe.
Father?
You like it?
I found it.
I don't know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Well you know it's okay.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
Do you not like him like daddy?
St. Mike's.
Damien Karras.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I stole it.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
No.
Uh Huh.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Defender of the human race...
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Be silent!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Are you a relative?
Why not?
You're not going to drive.
We don't need you, Frankie.
We have some lotion.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Baker.
How will he eat?
Accident?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Am I late?
Jack...
Fuck him.
You got weird kids, Frank.
It's more than that.
I don't gotta go.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
It wasn't like that.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
How about these?
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What?
Huh?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Just until we find another girl.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
No.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Seventy-one
Shut up, Frank.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Thrilling.  Both of you.
All right.
Doctor's orders.
Blanche.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Impersonally.
We ran long.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Am I missing something?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
They're nines.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Piece of cake.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
What?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Baker.
Downstairs.
He leads, I follow.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Every year.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Better than that.
Nothing.
I'm not upset.
Who's Nina?
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap?
Huh?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Huh?
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Is that what you used to do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Wow.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Huh? Oh, no.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Shut up.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
We need to talk.
How come?
Don't hang up ...
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Not anymore.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
I'm going to have you fired.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
What?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What do you know about it?
Have fun at work.
-- I've got to study.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Gone?
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
Great.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Seven.  Really.
Sure.
Got it.  Good tip.
Great room...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Is it...?
It’s just two kids, right?
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Pretty much.
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Everyone needs something.
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Give me my goddamn life back!
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
It’s lovely...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
You’re kidding me...
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Okay...
And now...?
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
Are you okay, Jack?
It’s good to see you...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
If it's something you feel strongly about.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Five times.
This makes five.
<u>Should</u>?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Victor must've taken him.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
What about you?
Ben, are you there?
They're not costumes.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
So are you!
Last one down springs for room service.
Okay, "mom."
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
Why didn't you say something?
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
<Me>?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Now I know...
I always thought it was nothing but red.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Yes...
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
That line was tampered with...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sort of.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Uh -- what?
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Was there any damage?
Then don't drift down further.
Where's my daughter?
I did.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
We split that.
Yeah, you already said that.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, he's adorable.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Mr. Mohra?
Uh-huh.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Uhn.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Ya kiddin'!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Huh? Yah?
...Brainerd?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir? Right now?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Ya got the car?
...Who they playin'?
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
The heck d'ya mean?
...There's a million dollars here!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Uh-huh.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, no, that's fine.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay, Mike...
Norm?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Three-cent stamp.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
He's at Norstar.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
He was killed in action.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Yeah, both of us.
Some of it, yes.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
I'll expose you.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Really?
The girl had done her homework.
I suppose.
Marla?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Good.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Don't ask.
Yes.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Yes, you can.
What fight?
My dad.  No question.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
If you could fight any celebrity?
Any historical figure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Okay.
I said I promise!
Uh... nah...
Look at your hand.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
We don't... ?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Tell him!
Look...
What are you doing?!
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
What are you talking about... ?
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
This isn't possible...
What... what are you saying?
The house is rented in your name.
If you know, I know.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why what?
You need me.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Maintenance.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
You and your friend.
How'd you know?
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Why?
Too much school.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I have to save Eugene!
Should we knock?
We need to hurry.
Random, sure.
Carter.
Blow me.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Like what?
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, Dad.
What feeling?
Nice try, kiddo.
He's not a witch.
As in flannels and plaids?
Like... 4:25.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
That's a plan.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
No.
Star Wars?
Show me how it operates.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There are no worse places.
No cigarettes.
Yeah...
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
I suppose you have...
Nguyen is good boy.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.
We just take pictures?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
American.  Come to get you out.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Meeting ... people.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Really?
Got any more bread crust?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Why this is outrageous!...
Okay.  ... I love you...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
And who's Lydia?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Thank you very much.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Thanks.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
You can ask.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
I'm the one what?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
What are you doing?  Give that back!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You really want to help me?
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
The Red Knight!
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
What?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
OWW...MAN...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
You don't have to say that.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Serveza yourself!
Out where?
You can sing the song.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I'm not.
Yes.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Where are you going?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
You know who it once belonged to?
Everybody still up on the Island?
Don't tell me about this...
Wait...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Thank you.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Catherine...
What?
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
It's all right. I'm fine.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Hold onto this.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Is it true?
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
No.  What you do today?
Nah, we make out and stuff.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I did.
I kissed those girls.
I can't!
I can't man, I'm punished!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
For real?
You gonna talk to him?
Wha'?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
She didn't say she had no man.
Not really.
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Unbelievable.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Well, which one?
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax....
Breathe easy...
Just relax.
No idea.
Like tonight.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Gum thought Brazil.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
I'd have been long gone.
Whoops.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Velma.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Fletch?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Charmed.
Come inside.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
They serve dinner on the flight?
You sure got the hard part.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John! You used to fly together!
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
I have this effect on lots of women.
Hi.
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
It's amazing.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
How do you know about that?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Very good, sir.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
What?
Lock's busted.
She moved out.
This morning.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'll do my best.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Contacts.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Fluck you!
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Twelve pack?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Who's my real father, man?
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
I'm off it!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Fuck me...
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
What?
Doyle.
I'm clean.
No. 
Boca?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Goodbye.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Encore du sho ping!
Pour moi?
Il fallait le faire.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
He got off on six.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
You want some eggs.
Morning.  Sometime.
Who's on him?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We put him to bed for the night.
Just for mistakes of parking?
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
So what?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Switches are shorted out.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I'm serious.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Do you know where I found this?
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Queens, New York.
Hello?
What?
Yeah...I think so.
I think I'm losing you.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
I'm glad.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Yeah, I think so...
It's not your fault, Dad.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What...
Okay, okay...
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Huh?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Uh, huh.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
No.  What house you work?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Cool it, Andy.
I'll think of something.
Barely.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
Did you stay here last night?
Are you all right, Shelly?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Stick around and you'll see.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Damn you, Shelly!
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Great.  Just great.
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
My ass.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Daddy, what is going on?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Okay.  There's one.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
'Cause it stinks.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
I found it outside.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
I've seen it.
Please don't do anything crazy.
The what?
Twenty.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Not so bad, today.
Okay, I'll call you later.
June the 19th.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Sorry.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Her name's Stephanie.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Oh my God, Steven.
Okay.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Really?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
They're out of town.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
What are you talking about?
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
It's not that simple.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Where are they?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Very big.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Do we care?
Do not inhale.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Don't wait Efor me.
Where is it?
She was very evasive.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Can he get through it?
About what?
They'll lose because they're my team.
That's completely crazy.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
It's only our first date.
Packs an emotional wallop.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Life is good.
I don't know if I can say that.
Right here. At the door.
You know the answer to that.
My back is killing me.
So what are you going to do about it?
That's a simple subject.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Matthew.
Because God loves a winner.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
hat was this morning.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Alla puttanesca.
Is what true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
As I told you about English policemen.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
All the more reason.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Panditji -- please, help me.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That was England.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Grudges?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where did you get this?
Often.
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Six one.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
They found my eyelash.
In a corridor.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
I'm sure I could have.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
You may as well invite her here.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
Why not?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I was at home.
We were just looking.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Of course.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
New policy.
I'm not doing it.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Beynon.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
I bet.
It looks fine.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
No. It's been a long time.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Want to cry now?
For exits off Main Street.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
What do we do?
You bastard...
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Not now.
You want to try with me?
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Pull over.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Where?
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
'Bout five thousand.
Just... tell us what you want.
That right?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
That's nice.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Yeah.
Expect so.
Your brother? What you talking about?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
No.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Yeah.
No.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I see.
It never is.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
They came back?
Don't ask me.
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
What's that supposed to mean?
No. Are you tired?
Jack Carter.
No, I didn't know that.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Still got your sense of humour.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
We've got to take you back to London.
The gun he means.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
No.
...they hold on to their money...
Eh?
No.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What hard part?
What act?
No.
That's what I...
They...
When they...
What?
What?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No, we're just...
Yes.
Well.  Well...
We are?
I'm sorry?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Why would they come to me?
No.
...and rob the place...
Absolutely.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Is that what I just said?
How ya doing?
They're ancient.
What?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
You...
Who are you?
Would you excuse us, please.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Murray said...
Murray said...
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
Not lately you can't...
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
It's not impossible.
Yes, I am.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What?
You're so full of shit.
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
They took the phones...
Last night, this morning.
Yes.
Oh!  For the magazine...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Mm.
What do I...?
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Three days.
If we wait till Mon...
It's not me, it's my wife.
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
What does that mean?
She told me not to talk to you.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm going home.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Yes.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I'm not hungry.
Oh yes, the very best.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Not for strangers; for my country.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
And you believed that story.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
Beautiful.
Why?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
How long does this go on?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yes.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I don't know.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
The room has a bug in it.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
You haven't heard me.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Not for a few years.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No, I'm fine.
Yes.
No.
When do we talk?
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I thought we would meet alone.
Keep them alive.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We got no choice.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
Weird.
What's to be jealous of?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
It never crossed your mind?
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
What do I do?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
Huh?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Broke is more like it.
You don't say?  Which picture?
Your family ate dripping?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
But we have to match the other sketch.
You first.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I didn't --
You're the one who started it.
I'm game.  Sure.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
I'm very sorry.
What'd you say?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I just want to watch it, okay?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
So what do I do?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Of course.
Oh dear.
Luminal.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Just go.  We can manage without you.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
A visitor.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Tell me about Kip -
Jesus ...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You know my back -
Let them go --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Donny-nothin'!
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Gray.
You know where the others are?
That's a good one, Donny...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Yeah... You want a ride...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah --
I can handle it --
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn't pay --
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
For real?
On account of me.
A distinction worth noting ...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
That what you want?
Very good...
Oh, yeah.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I think so... They're just... So ...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Cut 'em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
What's that?
He's gotten involved --
And the moral of that story is -- ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I'll see you soon --
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Wha?  Me?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Liar!
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
That again.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Jezuz Christ!
Let her carry this shit inside.
It'll be okay.
With what?
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got seared.
I got scared.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Nah.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Yeah.
Will you stop.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You're some fucking jerk.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I got dry cleaning.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
But, Paulie, please.
--or a tail--
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
No, I had to talk him down.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yeah, it is.
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
I told you, I just got change.
Shut up.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
I'm Irish.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Somethin's in my room.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
I think so.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I appreciate that.
Uh-oh.
I did.
I got your card.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
Not at all.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Who?
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Now wait a minute--
Hold on!
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't have any anger at you--
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
There is somebody...
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
This is a real piece of shit.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You've never been out of Boston.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Hence, the word remarried.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
What?
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
No.
Not far from here, South Boston.
What?
Yeah, but how do you know?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
At least you have a mother.
No, you don't want to hear that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Don't hold me so tight.
Sure, but what is this?
Which way is House 25?
Got a warrant?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
That's our place.
They never wrote you nothing?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I don't know.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
You been acrost?
Hush!
Didn' you have no breakfast?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Sure. We aim to.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
I'll walk back.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
She'll be awright.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Ya say we're acrost?
You promised, Tommy.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I know that! But *where* they gone?
California, here we come!
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
I wisht it was day.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never--
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
Wonderful.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Like heroin?
I'll hide.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Hard to get good help these days.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
I guess.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
He using her.
All of it?
I'm not happy.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
That's good.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Need a lift?
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
I am comfortable.
Tom.
Annie!
I don't care! We'd be together.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I don't care.
I didn't know I had to.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
About what?
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Who's there?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Exactly...
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I love you.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
About what?
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Take your time.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Oh, I don't know...
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
You!
Diane!
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't have all day.
Sure.
I want to watch.
No, not yet.
Maybe... look -- just...
NO!
I know. Amazing.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Sometimes.
Don't move!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Again?  Yeah sure.
I want it.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Go fix the phones.
Yeah, mom?
And unpack.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Blow me.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Razor and Blade.
Burn!
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
What?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Yeah?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I'm sorry, I can't.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Yeah.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Homicidal?
Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Excuse me?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
So?
Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Thank you.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
All right.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Michael Myers.
What does that mean?
Go!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
It's okay..it's okay.
How do you know their not?
About what?
I can see this is useless.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Drive Carefully.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Do you love me Rachel?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
I don't want to.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Then we'll be safe?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
It isn't a man.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Okay. Bye.
Of course.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
He can still watch.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Here, Lester.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Michael's around someplace...
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Could have...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Hi, Tommy.
Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
After the movie.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I killed him...
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
I'm wasting time.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Are you really interested?
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, it's magnificent!
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yes.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Let's take a look.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Like what?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
You're out looking here?
Yes, I do.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Did you ever read this one--?
What are you doing?!
But not over me?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
I know it isn't.
Oh, all the time.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
I know.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Because he likes you.
They're in the basement.
No.
I'm sorry.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh...
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
But not you.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
No.
Really?
I think we need to eat.
I got two minutes.
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I think so.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Oh, yeah. 
Singing?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
You got it.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
How?
Hmm!
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I remember you.
Well, I hope you've changed.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
You have.
Hmm.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
...which I did not get.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Take our literature...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Then who's buying it?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...are you alright, sir...?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Show me the Pigs.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I've never heard that he...
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
You seen John Brigham...?
...what'm I looking at...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
...should love to correct your error. 
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
I'll have them picked up.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
No. 
Is it necessary to know?
What is that that smells so wonderful.
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...what has she done to harm you...?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Why?
...<u>what</u>...?
...and that is what you need to expand.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Hey, lost again.
Brazilian. 
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
...yes, yes, yes....
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...no.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
...would you use a small word?
...why?
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
What are you gonna do about it?
You're all making me blush...
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yeah. And?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
So what?                                                    ]
How do you mean?                                            ]
Yes you do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Do you really think I care?
Not now, Wendy.
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
I'll think about it.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Heather.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Suicide is a private thing.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Chick-en.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Oh.
Did not.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
What?
Punch it in!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Get a job.
That's three things.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Come on through.
Open this door!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
gives her a sympathetic look.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
It doesn't matter.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Him . . .
This . . .
What??
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
All right, then.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
I'm stumped.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
What was it?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
What?
Yeah, how's that?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
This isn't happening.
In a word? Lucrative.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Wow you are out of it.  
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
What things do you think you've done?
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I got your bail continued.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
Vietnam!
That's not what I mean...
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
Never reach out!
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Who?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
So this really does the trick, eh?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Isn't that always the way?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
A man scared me.
Uh huh.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Stop knowing me so well.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
What?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Where should I hide the car keys?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Do you have enough money?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
The thermometer's broken.
It's a double.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Central Park.
Is that it?
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
How long is the voyage?
Me?  Of course.
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I would like to say goodbye.
The past?
I remember you.
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Because it's my name.
New York is dangerous place.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
So?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
It will end tonight.
He will not stop until it is over.
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
I know, Paul.
That's what the Kurgan said.
No.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
He knows better than that.
It's happening right now.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
I'm going to my desk.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
I'm here.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
What?
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I got the gasoline --
They'll cut the power.
Okey-doke.
What do you mean?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
You'd better be kidding.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What I want is to help my father.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Stop it.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Another minute.  Please --
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Yes, sir.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
We're okay.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Yes.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Your phony FBI assholes.
We, who is we?
I'll be back.
I don't have that much.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Canadian Club?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I can't, I don't have the men.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did you overhear?
What did they say?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
The police are very busy.
I'll be over.
No.
I am on a list! What list?
Fuck you.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
What?
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Of course.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
Stay with the children.
Get in.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
It will do just fine.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Why?
Tell me what it was.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
Paul! Then another voice.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Why?
Many beers.
Thank you, sir.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
The staff, the guests.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Can I help you?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
I'm confused.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So what stopped her?
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
Oh dear.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Yeah...something.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
I don't know!!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Yes.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Best of a nightmare.
-- yeah, we did that --
Most fun I've had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
He's gotta still be down here.
I don't do groups.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- I pose you the same question --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- my loss --
What?
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
-- confirming everything we already know --
Why not?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
He must've unsealed the room!
Over here.
What will they tell you?
No!
A few years older, perhaps.
Good-bye.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Maybe it was Colleen...
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Daddy help!
Well, that all depends.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
What?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
I think everything's ready.
Should I...
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm ok.
Yes, I am.
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Good night.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
Jesus Christ ...
I know what I saw.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
So where is it?
What happened to him?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Unh-unh.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
I laughed, I cried.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Gum.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
But I said I was sorry....
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Why not just go now?
Too-do-loo, babe.
Ooh-kay...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
That's what you theenk.
How long were you in?
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Baseball, why?
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
I guess that's a no.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why George, you big softie...
The Dancing Dingus!
Sharp.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Why yes, do you know it?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
You know, on farm route 17.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Every year?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer --
He grins wolfishly.
Terrific.
Tell me about it.
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Forty-eight years...
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah?
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
You --
Wait a minute!
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
But, sir! --
Sir, my leg is on fire!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
He notices.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
You don't believe in it?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Yes -- on the boat.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Of course, Wes.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I love Fort Holland.
You didn't drive her mad.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
To the asylum?
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
You want to go?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Elena.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Good.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Ben--
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
It's not like we're too busy.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
They say you never forget.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
I gotta get to English class.
Am I right or am I right?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Major.
Let's see!
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Tell Sandy? What?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Huh?
Yeah. Yours?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Can I come?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
The ones you built?
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Huh?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
What's the D.A. got them on?
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
I don't remember.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
I know.
Why?
What I saw?
No.
I told her to come.
What?
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Will?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
What kind of stuff?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
You don't know.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Who?
But she was an attractive girl.
Did you have sex with her?
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Ah! You have questions?
Nothing if not vampires...
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then God does not exist...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
No.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Yes.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
You really believe that?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
But if she dies...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
Yes...
The crucifix -
And if I don't?
Fascination...
Paris? You came from Paris?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I don't pretend to know.
I know. Let her alone.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
NO!!!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No...
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Can a vampire feel love?
No...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Yes!
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Karla! You promised.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
I've got to see.
Then, we fight --
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
You're okay. Thank god.
Can't what?
This weekend?
Fine. Show me the body.
Who?
Wait, it's Nancy --
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
It beets being on the mainland.
He's in it with Willis?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You don't have to be a jerk.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
And do what with it?
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
In case you do so, would you --
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
My friend -- what can one say --
No.  She shall not be left here.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
No one can take my father's place.
Poor Cathy --
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
They shall not hurt you
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
Thea is an orphan.
You have forgotten my last name?
But one must love a father.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
It was, the plague
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
That your father and I ——
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Yes?
Her name is Thea?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
Thea?
We have no time for that.
How did she die?
You are my friend.
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
It is for that he hates me.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Who?
All right –– all right.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Well, who are you, then?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Where is she?
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Well, what happened to you?
Uh-huh.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Goodbye, Sam.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Hope you enjoy it.
Okay.  What's yours?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
He's pretty young for that job.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
You like it? I'll send you a box.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
I'd like to do that.
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Thank you.
Don't you like her?
To keep from being an old maid.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
What plates?
Sure, sure I am.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
Someone pop your balloon?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Back down!
Swim for it!
Yee-hah!
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
Can you get us a line?
Aren't you off-duty?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Not the drugstore!
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Please.  It's my job.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Okay, okay.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
You said something about a camera.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Me neither.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
What's that supposed to mean?
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Sound?
So there's one around here.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Why?
Better yet.
What're you guys doing today?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
We have to do something.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What for?
That's it?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Shouldn't he be at home?
Hiya yourself.
Sure they did....
Now I really want to see it.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What Kids?  Who went out?
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Power line.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
No.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Coming about, then.
You always go with Andy.
No.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
I can get it.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
What is it, 97 days?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Get out of here!
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
No.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Make up your mind.
I know I can capture it.
Sounds wonderful.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
So tell Calvin.
I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
But you --
I'm  fine.
I thought they were clever.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Why are you?
She, Mister Hutton.
They still seem nervous.
Not good enough.
Someone's looking for you.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Calvin said it was all right.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
It's large enough...
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Don't hurry back.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
We're in love.
That's what grandmas are for.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, I did.
He was doing his job....
Nowhere....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Then don't come any closer.
What's wrong?  What happened?
It went away....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Adds flavor....
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I'm still five....
It's not nice to be evasive.
Good night, Daddy....
I'll miss you....
Mother....
I'm just getting started....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I'm not going to quit now....
I'm fine....
Why'd you come out here?
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
No one does till they learn....
Nothing....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have my own little island.
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I have coffee in the thermos.
You got a better idea...?
You sure you know how to do this.
Get her started....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Stop busting my hump....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
The females have eggs....
Put me down....
When I signed on....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
What?
How long has he been here...?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Yes.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I already did. What's his problem?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Listen to me saying what?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Bits.
I don't see that at all ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Once.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Maybe he's lying to you?
What are you looking for?
He ain't offerin me shit.
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
Yes.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
He said that? What else did he say?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
No I'm not.
It's not possible right now.
I'm going back to the institute.
I can't identify him ..
I don't want them to arrest you.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Whass going on here?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Could you just stop moving?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You're imagining it.
Oh, tell the story.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, take care.
You think so?
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Thanks.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
You don't have to explain.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Good night.
Same to you.
Oh hell yes.
Easy, easy --
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
No--
Please, if I start talking --
Said who?  Sugar?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Very much.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Forget it.  Forget it.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No, you're --
Damn right.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
What --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Well.  Good luck with that --
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
How sad --
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Funny.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Just drop it Paul!
I filmed this the morning they left.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Think.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
You mean it?
How low?
Who's that?
I thought you were an expert.
It won't hold!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
NO!
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Which one do you prefer?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Yeah.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Something must've scared them.
You should.
No we're not.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
This plane can not land!
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Not without a shot of the nest.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Where does it say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
What?  Why?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Possible.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
No.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
What's that?
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Funded by whom?
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Are you insane?!
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Oh, no!
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
How would we cut off the lysine?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Six weeks?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Look.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
The - - agility.  You're right!
I know.
- - barfs them up - -
The fences are electrified, right?
They're not here.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Like hell it is!
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
He sends his apologies.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Listen, ahh - -
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
"Thunder lizard!"
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Why?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
The kids okay?
You're sure?!
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Wu?
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Let's get you out.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
It's safe.
I'll stay awake.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
They don't bother me.
You want to put in chain saws?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I really think we should go back...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
What?
_Krueger_...
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Who's chest?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Video store?
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
None of that's true?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
That's open to debate.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Yes.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
One of you must be mistaken.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
He was murdered.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You don't believe that.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
-- Listen to me --
-- Just doing our job.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
Oskar.
You look tired.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
And we're upset too.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
It's ... lovely.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They' re dead.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
She was with you after she left Frank.
Please --
Yes?
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Don't belong?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Will you let me go then?
My name's John Klute.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
What do you think?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
No, I said what did you think.
Thanks.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
How?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don't get you.
My bed.
Yeah.
I was wondering what that was.
Right back at the start, right?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
With Trina.
About what?
Can you use these?
It's got to make sense some way.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Just send me a money order.
Two years ago? Sorry.
She told me.
Has she talked with you since prison?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Welcome to the... 
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
In a minute...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's okay...
You're no bargain either, pal.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sure.  Lots of times.
You like it?
Uh huh...
No, she never did.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Like a principal?
Sustained.
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  Very much.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Objection!
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
Yes.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Do you have a lover now?
I suppose...
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
What?
I don't know...
So do you.
Yes...How's Billy?
You want what?!
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
What?!?
Kramer--
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Ted?  Are you there?
How the hell are you going to do that?
No, but--
Ten.
I'm sure.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Uh, huh...
Here. We'll collect them.
No!
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
I will not approve it.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Soon.
We did not.
All?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Time to study.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Answer. 
What do you think?
I am him.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Ask whatever you will.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
I leave tomorrow.
But you will always be here?
You will always!
But, I have no experience.
We have.
What would you do, Holiness?
No.  Do you?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
They don't really attack underwater and--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Then do it!!
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Get the gun.
Right.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
So I don't like tents, why--
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Good.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Night.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
You calm down!
You wouldn't?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
So does he.
You too.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
I'm fine, thank you.
Yes.
What kind of backup do we have?
I thought I saw...
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack's handsome?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Wait.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Kelly--
Backstabber?
Shitbutt?
Why not?
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Hot damn, Clarice.
I don't know! Get me out!!
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Starling -
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
May I see your credentials?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Who killed your patient?
Was it a butterfly?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Can we rest soon?
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
Why did they turn back?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
I have nothing to go back for.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
That is sedition! Treason!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
What else?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Gifts?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
And this?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Granted.
He did.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
What has?
He did.
Fuck your orders!
How do you know it was Williams?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
How much time does that give us?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
It...almost got you.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Twelve hours!
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
Let's hope it holds.
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
The air's stopped.
Your pocket?
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Hit the fuckers.
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
A hundred grand.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
I like your bar.
Well, perhaps you can help?
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Seven hundred each.
I'll only be a minute.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
Er, fertilizer.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Just shut up.
Leave your sister out of it.
I can't take any more school.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
We were just dancing--
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
He a Black man or an Indian?
So they stayed in Florida?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
You lived in the States for a while?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
It's a lead mine.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Substance abuse?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Protection?
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
He was a unique individual.
'57, 1 believe--
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Buddy Deeds--
And the ten thousand?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
The Perdido thing?
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
He was killed.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don't mean Fernando.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Okay? He's not here?
He's going to wish he was dead.
Of course you can.
For a while.
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Well, you were working there--
We haven't talked since high school.
Most people did, yeah.
He hates me.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah.
I came back 'cause you were here.
I've felt that way, yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah--
Gotta be in person.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
You sell much out here?
No--
You know who it was?
I know that.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
You believe that?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Who is he?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
A Nix specialty?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Right.
I told you --
All right.  It was...
I could scoop them out.
Not yet.
It was me.
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
Yes...
Yes.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Sure.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Why?  Because he had you?
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
I told you --
Nothing?
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Hang on!
I... have... to.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
--vanished.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
It's one in the afternoon.
We've never met.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Are you a gambling man?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Are you a believer, then?
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Sure.  Vivovich.
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
I don't know what else to do.
Is that all?
And you're not?
And he didn't have them?
Yes.
In my time, and nobody else's.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
What about Philip Swann?
Why would I want to?
Yes.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
You'll do it?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Two years.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
No, how about you?
I'm here for the week.
Ok.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
No, yes, it does...
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Around.
Yes?
Oh?
Yes?
Yes?
Good-night.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Fine.
That's ok.
Tomorrow.
What?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
It's probably trivial.
Sushi.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I can't believe Will killed him.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Claire...
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
It's nothing.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
My secretary?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
What's the...OH SHIT!
What?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
What did he say to you in French?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I know who he is.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You are the younger of two...
Get out of here.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
We millionaires yet?
Of course.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
But you use potato?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Thanks.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Yes, we appreciate that.
Four days.
To do what you love.
Oh, great.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Chances are there's still a chance.
She hates all freshmen.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just like that?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Uh huh.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Your legs don't look broke.
Would you watch the damn road?
With a jacked-up attitude.
Hey.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
You're not stupid.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
The "man" again.
What the hell's going on?
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Kiss my ass.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
you woke me up to tell me that?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
Well, can you give him this for me?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
What's that, not great?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Said he'd be home later.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
What?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
No.
ooohhhhhh no.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
In my sleep, Burt.
What's wrong?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Who was it?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
You just move in here?
-- do you wanna cup?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I'm sorry.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
No, no.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I was listening --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
This sounds threatening.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Braces.
It's...doesn't matter....
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Do you wanna sit down?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
I'm trying.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Is this 509-9027?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- let's talk more about your background --
Not really.
Mm. Hm.
I'm quietly judging you.
Hollywood, mainly.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Is Linda here?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
Mmm.
...ok...
Calm down.
No one else in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
All your other fluzzies?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I'm drinking.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Yeah.
Yes.
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
...I don't know...
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
What's MOW?
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
....it's alright....
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
818-753-0088.
Yeah.
Water.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Maybe.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
See you.
Stand up.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
That is good.
D'Artagnan.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
I have it all worked out.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
To the Bastille.  And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
There are more important things than tits.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
No, not Louis!
Why didn't you say so?
Who?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is its antidote?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Thank you, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
I must insist, Sire.
Eh?
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Raoul... is in love...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah?
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
What do you need?
Where are you?
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Don't worry -
Fine...
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Who is it?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Up north.
Seattle.
No...
You'll find out - soon enough.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I knew I could count on you.
Both at the same bank...
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Screw him!
Where is he?
That's when it happened?
What's the bottom line?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
No.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
What do you want to do?
I know...
No other possibilities?
Why?
You.
What is it?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
I'll pick you up in...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What?
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Have him peel the top label back.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
What?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
Uh-huh.
I have work to do at the plant.
Are you okay...?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Not me.
Absolutely,
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
That's true.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What did he want?
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
You got a deal...
You going back down to Florida after?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
My name's Will Graham. I...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
That's interesting.
I want your opinion.
What do you want?
Pretty well.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Hi George!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Hi... am I late?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
You don't know the real me.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Yes, your Holiness?
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
It's my name.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
And you are?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
How?
He's beginning to believe.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
The agents --
This can't be...
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
She would say she knows enough.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yes.
Why?
Good.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Yes, sir.
Do it!
He is the One.  He is the One!
How did you know...?
Who?
But what?
I'm not the One.
How do you know that name?
From you.
Why?
It's going into replication.
Are you worried?
No.
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
Not yet.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Tank, it's me.
I'll be all right.
Let go of her.
You sure?
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Kennedy.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Panther!  Same thing...
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Didn't show up.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
Good idea.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
We'll be here.
I know.
Oh...around...why?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Here.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
A paper on that one too?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
The girls like it loud.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
 Shut up.
I know...I know.
Friends of yours Michael.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Hi, Allison --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
He said he would be there with bells on.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
What 'business'?
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Why yes, thank you.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
A voice?
What'd it say?
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
What?!
Yes.
What do you mean?
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I don't care.
Yours.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
You get not to go to jail.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Well, that's very interesting.
Yeah.  Neat.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Yes.
Rass!
Yes?
Are you?
You're welcome.
How did you meet?
But she loves you?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I haven't.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Watch me do what?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Gay?
I am.
How beautiful.
I love you in an evening gown.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
I guess so.
Of course.
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
So can I.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I guess...
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Not at all.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Get him in here.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
And we're very grateful.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
I am not a dream.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Of course.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
It's enough now.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
You think Drew will go for it?
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
You like him, don't you?
Probably.
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
That's all?
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
We've met.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
I don't understand.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I agree --
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Did I say something wrong?
But we've got time.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
As requested.
Leonard.
Hi, Leonard.
A cop?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Tell me about her again.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Kill him.
There are things you know for sure.
Just relax.
Where is he?
I'll go see him.
I have this condition -
Don't protect him.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Why not?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Well, that's me.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Why are you following me?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
It makes all the difference.					 *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Recruit us to do what?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Right now.
And what is that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Cost less.  That's the point.
Hola, viejo.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
Something's wrong.
Port-Au-Prince.
Who knows...
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Verdado.
Chill out Sonny.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yes.  What's up?
Bored.
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
"Future" of...?
Meaning...?
Do we need this...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
You're hoping to get a look at what?
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
Yeah, oh yeah.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
And what?
What of?
Who?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
They gotta be.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
What?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Gonna be like money from home.
Get down -- where?
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
...He had a bald skull and...
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Stop shitting me, man!
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
I'll pay extra
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Beats working.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
About as good as it looks.
Twelve years.
How long?
What do you mean?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Cut his fucking throat.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Work, work, work, that's all do
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
New York's finest.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
You got a better way up?
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
I pull.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Manny...
Maybe they lied to you.
So?
I was just late.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
How?!
Your arm, you can't...
That's it?
Gross. What is it?
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
I don't have a title yet.
It has no nobility.
Then the roads are open...
My daughter must be going nuts.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
My pleasure.
Misery?
I know how that can be.
Yeah, thanks.
No big deal.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Annie, what's the matter?
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
The what?
What?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
To Misery.
No, I haven't.
I'm almost done.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
That's nice.
What is it?
He's your client, huh?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Buster.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
You're still a writer.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Oh, I am.  Later..
'Thief in the Night?'
To do what?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Ninety-three point four million.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
..or hard wired..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
I'm not ready!
Exactly where is she?
Not for seven more minutes.
I hope there's a place to land.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
What if I pay the rent?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Oh, either way works for me.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Do what?
Indeed.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
You didn't do that badly.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
So do I.  Sort of.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Ethan, tell me -
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Yes.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
S.O.P..
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Krieger.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Take off your God damn coat!
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Theyíre dead.
One hour.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I wouldn't dream of it.
What about Job?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Where exactly is it?
We're not outta here yet.
Jack.
Always.
Just don't chew it.
Very well.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Can you lose him?
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Keep counting Claire.
Of course I can hear you.
I think I might just take that look.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Itís not working.
I always check the batteries.
And I'll have the special fish.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I'm going to bed now.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
No. You were there.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Ti amo.
You did this once it didn't work out.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Maybe.
Let's go tell your Mother.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
He's in Palermo.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
He knew my husband who died.
Instantaneous.
Why what?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You really are stupid, you know that.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
Get all of me. Take everything.
I've never seen a moon like that.
What?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
You ruined my life.
I'm in love with you!
But he wants me to come!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
It's the best thing there is.
I wanna go home.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
How can you ask me that?
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
She was too young for him.
I shouldn't.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
A month from today?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Sure.
We should talk alone.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Where you been?
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
It's late.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
You're kidding?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
You don't know where Loretta is?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
She was just too young for you.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
No.
Good night.
Sure.
You mean the whole house?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Oh. Right.
I knew she had it.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
...What?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
I'm not interested.
No one live there.
We want ... a shrubbery!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
You said it again!
No, it isn't.
Come on you pansy!
Come on then.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
You're a looney.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

A G...g...g...
What?
There.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Who did we lose?
I'm thirty-seven.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!
Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Here's one!
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Yes?
The Prince ... ?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
We'll cover your escape!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
We must examine you.
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Not down south you don't.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
The good-looking one.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
I'm getting dressed.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I hope to go up next year.
Out of my way!
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
And that is my last word on the matter.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
That's not good enough.
There are important papers from --
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
I am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Who by?
Have I ever let you down before--?
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
You can't know that for sure.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Dear oh dear.
No, indeed.
Cold is good!
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
A few days, ma'am.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
He is sick, ma'am.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Sure.
What's the question mark?
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
What the hell does that mean?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
Nick, what is it.
It's already out.
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
What are you going to do?
Dante's Inferno.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One.  In case...
We don't have a choice!
I know.
I'm okay.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Is that your question?
You have no time.  What is your question?
Of course I am.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
The game will guide you.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
You gotta be kidding?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
You got it! See you later honey.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Very pleased to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
What?
Diane?
But it said #12.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Maybe it's not me.
I'm not sure about this.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Good luck!
Okay.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
I just wanted to come here.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Where at?
Damn, that's a long drive.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm leaving.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
I don't help criminals.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
I said NO.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Thank you, sir.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
How can this happen ?
Thank you.
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Which one, this door is locked !
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Shut up ! It's me.
Zach from work ?
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Suspended from school, my mother??
I'm leaving Sunday.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Was it a nice funeral?
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Have fun.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
You are?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
oh.
Come on in!
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Hi.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Give it back Nicholas!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
WHAT??
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
May I use the phone please.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Give it to me!
Just give it to me!!
What do you think?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...

Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Was Rose.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Phil for God sake.
There's plenty of fruit.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Oh, sure okay.
But Dad'll never go for it.
I know, look at his little hands.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
This guy bonking you?
What?
Yeah, all right...
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
No.
What Hurts Vada?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Oh, how do you mean?
What happened to her?
Did she ever see Vada?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Yes.
It's only eight o'clock.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Okay.
Pointing upwards Look...
I know that, but what do you want from me?
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I love this guy! 
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Sorry.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
There were just too many of 'em.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
We'd love to hear it.
He likes her.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Thomas?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
It'll bleed.
Uh huh.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
What?
So?
But I have my clothes on!
I wanna live with them too.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Then go home, baby.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Well, let's spit on it.
Would you think of me?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Part of being a New Yorker.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You have a real philosophy of life.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You like her.
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Someday she'll thank you.
I wish.
That was Thursday.
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Hello.
Only.  If he wants to.
It doesn't say th...
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
Endearingly absent-minded.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Boy, those were the days.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Yes.
... maybe it's congratulations.
A bad combination.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
Like family, huh?
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
You're much more his type.
Right here.
What do you have to buy?
Grand Old Opera --
I won first prize.
Don't feel that way, honey.
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
Green.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
You know better than that.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
When is it?
How come?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm not really a musician.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Nash.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Bet the sheets are grey.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
When I was little, in church.
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, I don't.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I've got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I'm not sure.
That's unkind.
What...?  0h, yes.
Linnea?
Money's no object.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Might be good for you.
What!
You're not.
How long have you been together?
Do you study at all?
Just a minute.
Hello.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
More or less...
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
What?
It's video.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
She doesn't talk?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Says who?
Yes.
So, what now?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
I do, too.
That's the way of the world.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Where do the air ducts lead?
I hear ya. Play.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Rockin'!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
How 'bout Mallory?
Yeah, sure.
When do you want the assembly?
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
They're mesmerising.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose 'em.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
Guess I don't.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
You must be new in town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
What d'you expect?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Take it easy.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Four.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
What?
How about it?
Don't call them that.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Come here, baby.
You didn't answer my question.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Yeah.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Watch out!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
What's on your mind?
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
No, thanks.
She don't look no worse to me.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
No thanks, Lee.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Who is?!
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I doubt it.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Oh yeah?
'Musta knocked her up.
I know.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
How's the villa's security?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
What does this have to do with me?
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
It hasn't yet.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
What about McCoy?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
Are you even really alive?
The words?
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Jah guides us.
Right...
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
How are we doing?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
Case.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Almost two days.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Put the gun down, Case.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
What are you talking about?
Thanks.
Petty good.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Leave.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
That is lingerie.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.

Do I want to be crunched?
Betty.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Don't you remember what they called you?
Is that true?
Yes, desperately.
Rufus?
Really?
I don't have to say that.
Why do you do that?
Do you think you'll find her?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Why?
We're very evolved.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Well, a ball player.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
No!
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I know.
Just what?
No.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Oh, come on Dad...
It's not the gas, Dad!
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's this?
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
There's nothing to figure out.
Why won't you talk to me?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
No.  I'm okay.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, Kerry.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
Hi Mom.
Wait and see.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Do you still...see each other?
I -- I think so!
It's an amazing gift.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
I don't do that shit.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
It's been a long time.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call me Nancy.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Anything?
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Your dreams?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What about Kristen?
How do we get in?
What are you talking about?
What?
Mary Helena.
Cooling down.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Uh, fourteen.
Where...here?
Now you're lying.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
I'm an actress.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Let's go in.
Yes, you did.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Oh no no -- no.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
You and every person in this country.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Don't ask.
How do you think I'm doing?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
He wouldn't say.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
... get fired.
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
Working with Leonardo.
Me?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
It was good.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
This is Henry James film?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Definitely no comment.
No -- did you?
Is it someone we know?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
So -- any messages?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
What?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Would you like to start?
Mister Sefelt?
I was in luh-love with her.
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Mister McMurphy!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Right!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
H-H-Hearts.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
'K-k-kay, Mack!
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Yeah...
Ca-na-da...
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Right, Mack!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Lobotomy?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Just warmin' up.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
No!
Sure, Mack...
I'm not running a charity ward...
Just wait till you hear...
Yesterday...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
No! I wanna go!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
He's not!
Oh, what was that?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Because I quit breathing.
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
'Kay...
Come an' see.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Evenin', ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
I thought so.
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Let's find a telephone.
You're sure...
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Except possibly that.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
But, Faith--
Hi there...
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Non.  Please.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Does he love you?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
What?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Please.  I need to know.
NO.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh.  That's nice.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Yes.
I brought you that, too.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Oh.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
No.  He's never asked me.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
What about your job?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
'Course he does.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Oh my God.  Where?
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I'll be back before you leave.
And Larry?...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
You miss me?...
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
That was the idea.
It's a living.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Why Edie, I—
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
You training to be a nun or something?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
How would you've done it?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
How do you like it?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Well, it's over.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He wanted to see me again.
I don't want to hear it in there.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Mind your own business, Father.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Are you on the level, Father?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah?
Sure... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Hit me again.
First things first.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I was only talkin' to her.
Go on, beat it!
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Okay.
Where?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Nothing is worth your life.
Of course I do.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
It would seem so, Master
Well then let us proceed.
Is there time?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes, it is.
What?!
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
His assistant.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Her phone's probably tapped.
I'm a tourist.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Just hung up.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I saw Karen Sisco.
Yeah, I did.
They sure do.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Excuse me, Adele?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
That's right.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Of course I am.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Faye Dunaway.
You have to be kidding.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Shit...
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
You won't do that.
Those guys bother you?
What, as a sales rep?
You believe that?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You just did, for Christ sake.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
I see better with them on.
How many?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
How you know that?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Thanks.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I see that.
Hello?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
He was that good?
Red...Strange?
Sir, I --
A m-missionary?
You guys are new?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Home of the brave!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
We can explain, Colonel.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Stag movies. Smokers.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Just what you underlined.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
That's disgusting!
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Refresh my memory.
Would you?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Is this slow enough for you?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
How'd you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You're going to listen to me.
Of course.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But I'm remembering the future.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I'd love to.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Please don't shout.
Oh. I forgot.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
When do we start?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Pretty much so.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
It sucked.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
There's a better place...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Maybe it takes a while...
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Sorry...
Because they deserve to, Walter.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
I promise!
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Honesty is always best.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Don't do this, Andy.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Continue.
Makeup.
As in, the vegetable?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
What happens?
What impressed you about him?
What kind of person is that?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Something like that.
Yes.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection.
Is that a question?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
We were satisfied.
That's correct.
Not especially.
Duh...
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
My lettuce is wilting.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Helloooo...
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
Lookit. Lookit!
They're coming.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
I can't....I can't....
Don't do this to me....
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
I know what's in here!
Possibly.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
25 kilos each, huh?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
What, you're goin' off, too?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
What?
And what about the cells?
Rain.
Which half?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Looks clear.
So which one caught your eye?
What do you care?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
The evidence was very meager --
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
That way.
None at all.
Let's find them all.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
I'm for that.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
I think you're making a mistake.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Why special?
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Okay.Up to the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Why not?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Where?
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
How the hell did he get away?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
No... I move faster alone. 
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Well..
I really don't know.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
Just drunk enough.
Immigration Officer?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
I don't.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
That's all there is.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Bad enough.
Dance? Here?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Killaine...
Do you have to leave the note?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
You-killed-him?
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You understand perfectly.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
We know everything.
Who's Goble?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
You mentioned information.
Got the information on you?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Martini.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
You're not English.
How's life treating you?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
I don't think you locked your door.
He saw my face too.
With what motive?
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Floater?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Go live in a tent.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Warm water, no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Not if it clears the air.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Yes, sir.
Two.
That's not very kind.
You already have the checks, darling.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Yes.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Yes.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
No.  I'd want to--
Freshman and sophomores...
And to history.
That's her.
And I didn't like that man.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
How nice.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
I might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
No jokes.  James is in love.
It's shit.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Are you up to something?
What about the Cromwells?
Take a look at these.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Now listen...
Darling Susan.
Oh no!
I won't.  Goodnight.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Where?
I say when it's over!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Zero distortion, sir.
Fine.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They took a left at the next light!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
No way, old buddy.
This gets better by the minute.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
We're going to need everyone.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
It pays.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
... dollars?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
I got a dress, yeah.
Any good?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
He died a long time ago.
He's good at what he does.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Vivian...
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
You won't.
What do you mean?
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It was good.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
We just did.
Vivian's in sales.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Was that you?
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I pray for that.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
You're a guest here?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
It's very expensive.
Excuse me?
Yeah.  Thanks.
I think it's great.
Then I'm here till I die?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Of course.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Of course you will.
Well ... you were dead.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Veer left. Left. Left!
He's really very short on charm.
It's you.
How many could you handle?
-- what? --
-- where?
But you don't know where he is.
I have a little.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Right, right, sorry.
What?
What is it?
Yeah. It's really good.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
You want me to read this or not?
I don't understand.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
He's already dead.
Hah?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
You're sure nobody's following us?
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I smell nothing.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
An hour.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"Of the silvery moon,
"Honeymoon,
"Keep a shining in...
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But what if the play was a hit?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Liebkind, no!
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Vat?
What have you done, LSD?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Tell me all about her.
Of which morning?
Or arrived with her.
How did she pay you?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
If she paid you well?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Money.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Five hundred.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
You've led a charmed life.
Where's the old highway?
Yes.
Sam, I'm going.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Sam.
Without calling me?
Well?
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I'm glad we didn't.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Hospital clean.
Sam!
Sam. This is the last time.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Sam, let's go get married.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
No.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Uncommon, too.
What are you running away from?
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
To a private island, like you?
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Why?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Did I?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
The wound is bleeding!
No?
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I don't agree with you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
At any time. You will always be welcome.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
You give me a pain!
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Yes.
He can't hear you.
Day or night?
So I can move on.  You too.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
What did you expect?
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Am I hurting you?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Good night, Rose.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
You won't die, Rose.
Five hundred rabbits?
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, yeah.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
What did you say, Brother?
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
A wonderful woman, boy.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Yes, of course.
What time is it?
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Got yourself up?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
What?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Galley proof.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
What... ?
She's fine, as if you cared.
What do you want me to do about it?
Relax.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Same day as before.  I think.
Wha... ?
Bullshit.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
You're lying...
No.
Nope.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
We've got the tape to prove it.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Well, sir...
What?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
It's our job.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Whatever goes bang.
All for one...
Beholden to none.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
All right. Stand by.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
All set.
That's all any of us can see.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lower it!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
You, too.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Let's see.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I will not fight you, father.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
On my mother's grave.
I told you, my car broke down.
Rocky!
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Yes.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
It's just a..a party Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
You know this earth - this person.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Oh my, my,
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
By accident?
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Morning after?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Yes, I do.
Do me another favor?
Sharp -- Real nice.
...Yes --
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paul.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
No wine.
...Ten minutes.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Charge it.
What's happenin' here?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Sparrin'?
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
...Tomato?
...What?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
When was they here?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
I never had good footwork.
Yo, Benny.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
...The guy's great.
Fine... That guy's great.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Looks, huh?
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Ice skate.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
...Tight.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Maybe --
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Eddie, come on.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
That was the idea.
Aah!
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
A Toon?  Noooo.
I rest my case.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Good idea.
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Of love?
Young Romeo is it?
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Welcome.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
NO! Mercutio!
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Is she a Capulet?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Of course.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And I don't believe you...
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Which leads us to...
And then...
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Bad company...
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
I don't have it with me...
I swear...
A post office box.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
That's it.
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Gets the job done.
Is that right?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
I just wanted to see something.
Know what?
Because that's what I would have done...
Gregor's cell phone...
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Very ugly.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
I'll work on it...
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You slept with the fucker!!
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I can't get enough of it.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Hell, it won't be us!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Torch it?!
What's that?
He saw everything!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
What are you thinking?
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
You killed him...
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Then we're screwed.
He killed her...he killed her...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
What are you proposing?
No.  Why?
You mean that guy was an agent?
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
What for?
He's irresponsible.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
And I'd take it out on him.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Could it have been this?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
We appreciate that.
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Hi.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I didn't say that.  You did.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Dwayne put the gun down --
Then what the hell are you all about?
What?
I was in the neighborhood.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
At least around here it does.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
So...what's the good news?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
I'm not getting an answer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
I'd like to see you try.
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
El Capitan?
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
That's right.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Try to land on your feet.
How you doin'?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
IT IS CRAZY!
What?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
How do you know?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
What is it?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
End of the line.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
No.  I'm going to find out.
Carter...
No problem.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Some Kung-Pao?
Fine with me.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
How do I know I can trust you?
Baby Duck?
Thank you.
You must come with me for questioning.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
OK. Say what it is.
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
No.
A little.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
We are both full of shit.
What?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Don't go there...
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stooly.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yeah, it's good.
No, fish is a PM food.
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Where'd you get it?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You have what I asked for?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Thank you.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
What did he ask?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Tootaloo.
Are you a reporter?
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Seven-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
You afraid to try?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Still sweet.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Of what?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
It's something I've always wanted to do.
She's the boss.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Not eight...
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
No.  It's my life.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Walter, I'd love to --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
No.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
So what happened?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I should say something in this about magic.
Becky?
Good night.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
He said hello.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
What?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Yes, I did.
Any time.
What?
Sure you do --
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
I don't think I could really describe it.
She died.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Why not?
I don't know --
Right, right.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
What is it?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
P.  Dad?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Oh, right.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
It's only ten o'clock.
Victoria? She's okay.
Who is Annie?
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Sure.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Hi.  Sam?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
What?
What's more important than sanitation?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Can be what?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
No.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
But honey ...
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
That's it?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Yeah.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Everything go?
This man sounds like a real catch.
Colette ...
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
What happened to your eye?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Trust me. We're safe.
And you admire that?
You really need to lighten up.
Ass first into the world.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I know a guy.
You on a roll?
Sorry.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What does that mean?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
If you say so.
Hey, I don't play that.
What?!
I'll keep that in mind.
Just some buddies.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
You go, boy.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Tell me what?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Yeah.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
That would be me.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
There's no motels around here.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Just admit you're wrong.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Where are your men now?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
In West Fork?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
The Army gave you that?
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Cap'n...?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Senator's son?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
It was nothing.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
But, sir...
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
PUSH!
That's not what we're here for.
Maybe.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Nope.
It doesn't take this.
Is it getting worse?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I'll do my best.
You're welcome, John.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Yeah, how so?
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Why's that?
I don't like that one.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Yeah?
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
What are we likely to run into?
Captain, he's fast!
What about you, Captain?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
And your former wife.
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Yeah.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Read it.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I am.
Come on, it's graduation.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Meaning?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Oh yeah!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I'm fine.
I know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
Bon voyage.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
No, but you stole from them.
Look at those eyes.
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Yeah.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh.  I was putting the...
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
I know.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Uh... okay... um...
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How do you pay for one of those?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
She's very successful.
So what's up?
Hey.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
It's up to you.
In Breslau.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
That's great.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
She's good.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
Yes.
Do what?
Christmas presents.
More.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
They've broken their pattern.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
What is it?
What? I can't hear you...
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Did it?
What?
Tons and tons.
No, I don't.
Finish what my son started.
Yeah.
The forbidden subject.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
What guy?
Tuition’s expensive.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Can we turn the light on?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
He filmed his victims.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
I'll give you one guess.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Where is your attacker?
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Don't do this.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
I counted four.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
We got free tickets.
But...
Where you going?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Hello.
I don't know.
Do I?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
More of a game really.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
What did you know about your mother?
Catch him, or kill him.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
What the hell are you doing?
Good twist.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
What are you talking about?
Let's get out of here!
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
W-what do you want?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
How do I know their voices are --
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
She looked dead. Still does.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
What are you doing here?
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Oh Sidney...
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Who is this?
You have to have a favorite.
Guess.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
You never told me your name.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Don't...
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I believe you...
That all depends on you.
No...
NOOO!
NOOOO....
Your call.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
I told you to send it back.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Yes, that's right.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
I owe you shit.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
And why would she do that?
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
That's the original part.
No you didn't.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
The why'd the police let him go?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
I'm not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Oh, god...
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Thank you.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
So what?  This victim...
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I heard.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
It's not too far away now.
David... please...
Spit it out.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
And, why is that?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
It's close.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
I know.
Okay.  But, what?
No.
And you don't?
Bullshit.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Oh, it's alright.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
I don't know... like fifty.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Then, he must write about these murders.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Big surprise.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
I... I don't understand.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Huh...? No...no water.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
No sir...pleasure.
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Leggo...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Good night...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Oh...
What?
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Not likely.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not no more.
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
Not far from it...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
No...not yet...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You crazy?
I got to fetch her home...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Only if I'm dead!
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
I just had a really strange experience.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Thank you.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
But what is the truth?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
I've killed my husband!
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Just call me Elisabeth.
We should leave the past alone.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
And the title of this piece?
It's good.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Ten pounds.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
That's me.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Partners!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Every word.
It is all locked safe in here
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
I did not.
Tomorrow
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
No, it will turn out well.
Go on.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
The daughter of his enemy.
"Is the day so young?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
But the plague
Oh
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Orsino…good name
and thus unable to declare her love
My lord.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
A theatre poet?
Serve.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
About what?
Why, thank you, David.
He couldn't get his car started.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Security.
There was a break-in.
You're not eating.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
So I gathered.
Yeah?
Cover it?
But there's no --
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
What?
Yes.
I see.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Just serve.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For the flat.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
-- which is a hack.
Open it.
Yes.
What? What's wrong?
Don't look?
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
For ever and ever.
No, I don't.
That's not him.
No, no, it's different.
What are you doing here?
David?
Oh, good.
Where he can't get it?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
It's the only way.
Everything.
Alex.
No.
You mean I can have the room?
Of course.
Who said there were four?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
That wasn't a question.
Yes.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
What?
No one. I promise.
No one.
I should hope so.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
Right here?
I'm not sure --
You must be Juliet.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Who?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
It turned out to be cancer.
I gotta talk to you.
Calm down, baby.
-- What?
What kind of treatment?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Right now, I just don't care.
Well she...
Uh-uh.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
No thanks.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
I never get my hair done.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Then what do you think?
I am not!
She is.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
He's a very private person, actually.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
You did, I know you did.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
I know... you don't know, I know.
-- we can't now.
Jackie, can we --
-- what?
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Look who's talking.
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
It's too late...
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
-- Oh yeah.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- how did you get here?
Great, great. I hope you make it.
What's gonna happen?
What?
No shit?
What?
Yeah, baby.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Great.
How did it go at the bank?
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
About what?
Who?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I do, Jill.
I'm very tired, George.
Oh, Christ.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- A wash and set.
But Mr. Norman said --
You're right.
Okay.
... this doing hair it's...
-- yeah?
Isn't that bad for it?
Well, what?
I know.
Who?
No --
A soap?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
George is going to open a shop.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Steve?
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Fine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Aren't you going to have one?
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I'll call you.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I guess not.
Don't be silly.
-- No. No really.
Jackie --
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
-- oh I don't know --
You're going.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
That's fine --
Yes?
You mean they ate each other up?
Yes, Dad.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Do you feel bad?
I guess so.
No.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Okay.
Okay, Mom.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Why not?
Yes.
Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
A nigger.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Grady... oh.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Sure.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Thank you for saying so.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Yeah.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Yes.
Which room was it?
Good.
Yes.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Go away.
Go away.
Wendy...
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Royalty?
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Fine.
Jane-
What's that?
What kind of noises?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Do I need one?
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What you say?
SING!
With love.
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Yes, Betty?
What is it, Betty?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Chops?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
That man -- who is he?
Were you wicked?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Bless you.
It's true!
Enough joking.
What? 
You mean black people?
No food?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
And whom would you call?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Come, Sister.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
I am?
What?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
But...
Saving you.  Move!
Oh?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Get a stenographer.
Maybe Hawaii.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Oh-huh.
A hiding place.
You won't even tell us?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
It didn't happen.
Yeah...
Which one?
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
A Benedictine.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Find 'em!
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Chosen me?
The militia?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I know it.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
I have others.  All I need is this.
What happened?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Should we go back?
Tired.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Are you so superstitious?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
They have done nothing of the sort.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
I do not know.  Away.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
I can show exactly.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Give me the big'uns.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
He does make some funny noises.
What?
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I thought I told you to keep out!
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
You told me to come by.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
All right then.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah, I did.
Two people.
I thought they was.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
All right then.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I love you, too, Mama.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Yes, I guess you are.
My history.
I didn't aim to.
No ma'am.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Do you smell shit?
No, we have to get this story.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Huh?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Yeah, I did.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Uh, better make it one.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
You got it.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Bully for you.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
What difference does it make?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I shouldn't have let him go.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Those are pretty hostile words.
Jesus.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
You don't really want to know.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
The inspiration.
I just did.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Here, catch.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Yes, please.
That's obvious.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
You done your math right.
Well, what if?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
It seems human.  To me.
You're implying th...
Why?  We're only talking.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And the next one...?
Pretty darn clear.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Like you couldn't believe.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You're right.  I better use two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Fell.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No.
Apparently.
I don't think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
The same.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Such as?
Get lost, will you?
It's entirely mutual.
A what?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Those two musicians from the garage!
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
- Type O.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
As far away as possible.
Now you tore the other one.
Fight it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I got pinched in the elevator.
And I'm not even pretty.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
That's right.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Security.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Like right after the ceremony.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
What?
Shut up and keep packing.
Get me Room 414.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Terribly sorry.
Stay as long as you'd like.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
I'm just going to get some ice.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Oh yes, we do!
I guess she's not in here.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
What's the big idea?
Me too.  Bye now.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
You're entitled.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Good night, Sugar.
Saxophone player?
My fault.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my flag steward.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Could be.  Do you play the market?
For your own amusement?
- Inauguration balls -
What theory?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
If it's at all possible -
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
They repealed Prohibition?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
I don't mind if I do.
It's the crews' night off.
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
You poor, poor boy.
Is it that hopeless?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Thanks just the same.
All right - if you insist.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
From a rich millionaire.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Big joke!
Yes, sir.
Spats Colombo.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Still--
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Oh, don’t be that way.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Yeah, kind of.
No.
What?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
I slept with your sister.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
What?!
I guess so.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Desperation?
Hi.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Hard.
Will do.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
What's his name?
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Yes, sir...
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Come here, son...
They gone to the field...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
David!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
I brought these walnuts to trade.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
Is there something I can do to help you?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I wanta see Nathan.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
My head hurts.
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Very funny!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
What?
And she's getting worse...
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Yes, hon?
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
It's... It's not good children.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
You bastards!!
What's the difference?
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Yeah, so what do we say?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Right away, ma'am!
No, it was worse than that...
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
You would know, dummy.
Canada is saving us!!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Don't call me dumb!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Magnificent, magnificent.
It certainly is.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Uh...
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Good help is hard to find...
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Why can't we?
You're right.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Sure.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
I'll do my best.
Hopefully sooner than later.
It would matter to us.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Mac.  What's shaking?
That's affirmative.
You're not from around here, are you?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Lemme see your ball.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
I'd buy it!
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
She's my mom.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I didn't think so.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Cool!
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
How Mr. Kastle?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
No. Do You?
Plan B is your dad.
Nothing.
So why do you stay?
I could let them go for ten.
Why not?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
What about plan C?
I'm looking for somebody.
Your time is up, busyboy.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
I can't see...
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
But she's --
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
High Voltage?
Do you see it?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Pull it, damn it!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
What?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
How drastic?
When was this?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Pull it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
He understands me fine.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What's inside the sphere.
Underwater?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Yeah.  Drowning.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth --
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
I have to reset the sub.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
You don't trust me?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
The refridgerator.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Something for burns.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
For what?
Your watch.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Don't you?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Is it?
It's not safe for you to be either.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Hear what?
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For whoever's in that thing.
You'd have to ask them.
It's an American spacecraft.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Fine.  I'm fine.
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Then what, Norman?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
But why would she -- ?
The three of us.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
You got her?
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
That's right.
Meaning?
"We are friends".
Really?
He's a pussy.
I don't see anything.
Unless it's an act.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
Could I learn to feel it?
What do you mean?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
They'll find its weakness.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
It's what I deserve.
Not enough, I guess.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Ace of spades.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
I got Games & Theory.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
You and me, huh ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Funny...
You're upset, that's alright.
Your turn...
Excuse me...!
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Good luck at the academy.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Who cares ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I'll go for that.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Should I be ?
That was just a mix up.
How are you, Carl ?
Thank you, ma'am.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
You got it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
What ?
All bands.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Sir, yes, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Yeah, that's right.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
To join with him.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
That is how V'ger will survive.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
This served the purpose.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Sit down, please.
I want him here.  Sit down!
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Our... 'insignificance'?
Mr. Decker... ?
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Precisely.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
To you, sir?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Who?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
It's in your play.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes.
Yes...
Goodbye.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Mmm.
What?
You got a paperclip?
Sure did.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Hi.
What?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Yes...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Morning, darling.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What are they offering?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
...they run on water.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Fifteen hands.
This horse is booked.
What'll I do for fun?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
She's a...
You can go...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
I've always seen that.
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
Mr. Bailey.
Then what is the...?
I, actually yes.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Is...Is the Movie!
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
I know, I know.
We, we have to give it.
I'm only trying to...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Yes.
I can't tell.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Well.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife just went into labor...
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I can only write on a manual.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I grew up on your mov...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I know you do.
I'm gonna nail it.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I didn't say anything to them.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
They're coming Fedex...
That's what I said.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Is that one hell of a kid?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Givvem a cigarette...
I killed her!
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I hate when you say that.
That will never happen.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Like how?
Well.  It's for you.
Secret's safe with me.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
She is but an arriviste.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Yes.
Here.
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Not use my words, please!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
But Rache...
You owe me a quarter.
Alright starve.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Is that like Luigi's?
Yes.
No!  I have to get there.
I helped.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Don't do this.
To make it easier for them or you?
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We're going to win this.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
But it's not on the schedule!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
Yes?
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Don't flatter yourself.
We can't live like that.
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Thanks, but it's under control.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
No.
Is that what he told you?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Are we.
Give 'em my number.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Rache, get out of th...
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey. What's up?
Oh.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I'll be your guest!
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Four brothers and five sisters.
No.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
This is work.
No.
My Jesus…
He's dead.
For rape and murder.
Yes, I do. I love them!
Nothing, I guess…
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Just the same.
Gee, you're home early!
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Thanks.
Say, Ni...
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Any books you like to read for fun?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
I know.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah. I know.
No, thanks.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
So where'd you get in?
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Oh.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
There's the fence...
What are you talking about?
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Are you going to kill us?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
I don't want any...
He's in there...
She's as good as gone...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'll let the senator tell you.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What!
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Dissent?
We can't--it's power driven!
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes, of course.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Oh, yes, that's right.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Do you recognize my voice?
Condition Red!
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
To peace on earth.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I presume the planes are armed?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Admiral Buldike?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Lothar, take your checks now.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Maximum ECM!
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Primary arming switch.
Forget it.
I've got one.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master Kong.
Recall what mistake?
Look, this is different.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Was it okay?
Typical male.
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Right now?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
And your mom.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Yes!
Sorry.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Buff...
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
No, no, no.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
In what way?
This is private property, my friend.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
He is?
Oh, yeah?
We were?
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Because I'm alienated.
Sooze wants to see him.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Ask your girlfriend.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Seven-twenty.
Look, why do you care, huh?
No.
What? What do you stand for?
Sooze.
Mm-mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No. No, no, no.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I, yeah.
Is that a threat?
For a ride.
Oh, fuck it, man!
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah.
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
New York, huh?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I'm always serious.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
That was so great!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
If...
Mm-hm.
You do?
I think I gotta go.
Where do you get your ideas?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Yeah.
I'm here.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Sorry, Kansas...
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
We were told you could "fix us up."
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
That you?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
But you're not married.
Uh...maybe?
Bank branch!
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Let it ride for a while.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Nothing for Ladd?
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Thank you.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Are you hungry?
I tell you this is half sold.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I'll make it short.
We're engaged.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
You're tough, all right.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
If you love me, Joe.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Thank you.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'll take care of that.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
Okay.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Yes, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Go on in.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
The doctor suggested it.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
Right with you.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
No?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But where?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Whatever you say.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Later.
I have to.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
Miss what?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I did.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What an adorable hat.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I've got things to do.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Theories?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
The scoop of the year!
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
It was just a trim.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Cigarette?
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
I have to talk to you.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
For what?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Criminals.
Then come with me.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Brad Wilson.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
Oh...I came close once.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Oh. You're going away.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Sure.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Oh?
Nope, but --
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
What about this week's check?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
One.  And a half.
Say who?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Fair's fair.
For what?
What will it get me?
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
We gonna crash?
We've already met.
You just did, with that great dinner.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Today coffee----
Where did it come from?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Lois, you're amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Let's go to my place.
Say you love me.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Everything on it.
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Good. My heart can't take it.
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
My kind of people.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
North.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Sentimental idiot.
We must combine our strength.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What about here?
Don't worry, I've got you.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
. . . And  very naïve!
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Destiny.
I am master now.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
One of them should've been you.
Got it? Otis?
Lois isn't here?
What's she doing in California?
North. It's north
I will.
Not really, no.
Don't you ever give up?
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Tough guy, huh?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
We just take it?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
Ready.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
I know...
What other one?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
All of us.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
How good it felt!
Twenty-four.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
195 pounds.
Very much.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
It is for me.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
It's a Twinkie, boss.
On radio waves?
We'll see how fast I can fly.
How are you?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
I will.
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
I'm not sure.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Billy, that's too early.
Can't you make it later?
When the game's over, I guess.
You believe that?
Well I don't.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berry-picking.
That would complicate things.
Yes.  He does.
What other people?
Yes.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
That's what he said.
Oh.
Oh.
And what was the weather like at this time?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
There's the Prescots...
Thanks.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, let's see what we get.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
Do you have this agreement with you?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
No.
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Don't even try to remember.
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
How will he do that?
As opposed to this T.V.?
Great.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Yeah, right.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
See my mother?
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Give me a chance --
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
No.  I'm going home.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
When?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Can't hurt...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
You're incapable of the truth...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
He goes out with girls.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What sort of thing?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why not you?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
You tell him, I stutter!
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
What ship?
Like you?
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Why did you call me?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Let me try mine.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
No problemo.
Drive faster.
Where you going?!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
SHOOT!!!!
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
And what it that?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Unknown.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
I don't know.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess it's possible.
Yes.
Five minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
and totally irrelevant.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Yes.
Three months.
No. Ours was damaged.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What is this, Emmi?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
I was warned.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
No!
Tell me about von der Null.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
This is absolute nonsense!
What?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One of my people?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Never heard of him, who is he?
His private life?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Absolutely not.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
You're late.
Alright!
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
We will, kiddo.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Right.
I don't understand...
The what?
Kyle.
Okay.  Talk some more.
What's that?
That's the way it was told to me.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
I can't sleep.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I know.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I just called.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't think he's breathing.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You pull me up.
My hero.  Let's go.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Why... ?
I think not.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Seriously?  What did they say?
I don't...
Wha... ?
Get out.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
No...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Which grad-school?
You shouldn't have.
Why?
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
You dodged a bullet.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Really?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop it!
Yes, very lucky.
There's nothing to forgive.
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
What is?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Have a nice day.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I know who she is.  Take a message.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
Attempted murder.
You warm my heart.
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You want company?
Where in the hell can she be.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Yes.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Test it.
That?  That's Hill House.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
It's okay... we're all here...
Nell, what do we do?
Oh!  You scared me.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Why'd she kill herself?
She was unhappy.
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
Mrs. Dudley.
Why would we --
It's all I could afford.
That's why we're here.
I know.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
No, it's getting worse.
I think so.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Then let's go get you one.
Then what good is he?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
We all did.
Not bad.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
She didn't write to me, did she.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
And that's where you met Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
No one else is even here yet.
Uh-huh.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Something like that, yeah.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Have you ever known me not to be.
I'll bloody well ask him.
What'd your father do?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Good luck.
You bet.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
I doubt it.
Susan.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Tell me.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
That right.
Way out of line.
Uh-huh.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
What is it, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Told what?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Honey?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Mm.
I didn't say a word.
Honey...
What happened to you?
You don't have to--
Honey...
I don't know. I don't think so.
I took Doris's keys.
...I don't think so.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
He a good man?
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
What the hell are you talking about?
...Nah.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
We're just closing, friend.
Great.
I'm in.
Why not?
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Let's go!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Like hell!
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
So the method of death is the only connection?
Correct.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
What is it?
All right everybody, hold up!
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
I'd say we're in its home.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Keep the animal quiet.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
I don't understand.
You were going to be married.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I can't!
One.
That's right.
Thank you.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.

Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Now.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Nursery?
Yeah, what happened?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
This is where it started.
Yeah...
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I made macaroni.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Who?
I don't understand.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Yeah.
When was that?
Yes. I know.
Yes.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
No. Don't bother.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Yeah, I did.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
And one little boy.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
How?
Your guess?
What's wrong, Scully?
What happened to playing a hunch?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
No you didn't.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
All I told them was the truth.
I was until about an hour ago.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Evidence of a massive infection.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't know, Mulder.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
This is great. This is fitting.
-- of what exactly?!
Very weird.
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Just like that --
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Where's Scully?!
I've got to find Scully.
I have answers for you.
What do you mean, walked?
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Why did we stop?
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
Give a kiss to Edward.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
If you believe that.
What happened to Charles Gish?
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
I got it.
No problem.
's broken.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
No.
Absolutely.
Awaiting his arrival.
Completely unaware.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Do you understand German?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He was Harry's driver?
They're forged.
Just another part I've got to learn.
What's that?
Tell you what?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Yes.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He told you, didn't he?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
I'm sorry.
And my passport?
No.
No.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
No, not yet.
Yes, of course.
Yes.
What?
Ever seen one?
Calloway.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Bring him in.
Which side of the road?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Take him to Sacher's.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
No, I don't know...
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Goodness, that's awkward.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
She's been arrested.
And - Anna...
Coffee.
A Roumanian.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
But you will.
The Roumanian?
Yes, yes, I remember you.
You saw it?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Yes.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
What else?
Joseph Harbin.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
That's the wrong one.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Richard, you know something -
Where did you lose it?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They don't have extermination camps.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Then I won't bring you....
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Why the fuck not?
I have a job.
People still need values, beliefs....
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Disease? What disease?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Then how come you're talking to me?
You can't.
What's it mean?
That's stupid.
What assholes.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Even though his dick is so big?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
A poison...?
Notice? Like what...?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
To hear them read Torah.
How did you...?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
You said they didn't have night guards.
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
I can tell....
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
No.
Valentine...
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
What kind?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
No.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Noireuter.
Great!
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
What?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I'm still here.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
... Are you sure?
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
No.
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Coffee might be nice.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
What's up?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Oh. Okay.
I forgive you.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Good looking?
Nice fellow?
I don't know —-
What about me?
I drink.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
You found the leopard!
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Tomorrow -—
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Not! I tell you. No!
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
I know. Funerals.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
We will ——
I know -- Teresa -—
Must it?
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
You a tourist?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
And that is the last time any...
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
You drive a hard bargain.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
You bastard...
Simplify and damn.
Should I?
Get to the point, will you...
Croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
Yeah.
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
A criminal?
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Emily...
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
This is a bad line.
What about an untrained pup, white...
Tomorrow?
...On holiday?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
No... No...  I swear...
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
The company. We all work for the company.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
We conclude our transaction.
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Three o’clock.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Should I come back in five minutes?
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Shut up!
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
Er... Yes...
How’s the boy doing?
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Uh-huh.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Cinq cents.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
You make it sound so simple...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
To avoid killing anyone.
And when was that?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
You think?
But... her army's so small now...
I'm... I'm not the king...
You did well...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Noooo!
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Go on to the next question.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Yes... they were.
I know...
God.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
No... not like this...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
No...!
No!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
No.
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What do you mean, they won't come?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
I don't think so.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, it is.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
And what does he say to you?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
How will we sleep?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Tough luck.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
If you need help...
It's a little cut, nothing.
Where are we going?
Stop it, Wladek.
I am... I was a pianist.
We're getting out.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
It will be very dramatic.
That is good, yes.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
No, no bible readers.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
No.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
On your piano, that is the swap.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
You've missed this bit.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
No.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
I had some appointments.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
They workin' for anybody?
Hackers.
What do ya want the others to get?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You sober?
I picked something up on the way.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why you doin' it?
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Think nothin' of it.
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
You move right along, don't ya.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
He's right, Les.
Don't think I know him.
No.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
He'll never do it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
I'm sorry.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just around the corner.
Nothing.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
You've got to get your mind off this.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You're talking like a crazy person,
Oh, Andy, Andy!
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I didn't.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
What do you mean?
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Oh, thank heaven.
I've got to see you alone!
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
You see how much we have to say.
Where are you going?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
And he still wants to marry me!
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Not a thing.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
What's he want of you?
What'd he think it was to you?
No.
Who's your candidate?
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Rosebreen.
He did!
Just what I said I'd do.
Never mind.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Go ahead!
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
But suppose some business comes up...
What'll I do if something comes up?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Yes...
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Hello, baby.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
What are you drinking?
They were kidding you.
Breakfast.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Someone get a doctor.
You did.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
It was his body that was buried there.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I don't know.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
No, Mr. Charles.
Home!
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
We can't just go off and--
So we wait.
Move!
What am I supposed to do?
Ready when you are.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
He's an enemy soldier.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
And let me guess who is.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
I have to answer him.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
There might be.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I did it!  I got the box open.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
We leave it.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
We're going to be right over here.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Just stay down.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll lie.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Sure.
Damn.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
It's got to be going better than this..
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
And then what?
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
When did you make the switch?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Okay.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
What?
It doesn't mean anything.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Oh, God!
You have to go with us, Wes.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
I think we found something.
All last night he could have been--
You want to say some words?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Violation?
What happened?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't go.
Don't be so sure.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
THX and me.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
I was lost.
What?
Where's LUH?
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Officer Reilly, vice.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Yep.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Your partner?
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Nothing.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Easy, guys.  
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
We work fast enough for you?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Helluva fuck factor.
We've created a monster.
Reilly! He's loaded!
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Take him!
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
What kind of bomb was it?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Ain't that a shit--
It's about this.
What?
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Report on the case so far.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I promised her she'd be safe.
I know.
And diamonds in the front.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Just a second.
Um-hum!
I've got to see you.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Otherwise I'll call the police
M'sieu Monescu!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
I would like to.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Spanish passports?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
As you like. 
Right!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Like that?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I know it.
Please! 
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Divine ...
I know!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
That's true.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Well, he was in the navy.
Yes, my bag!
The ship will sink.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
What do I tell your mother?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Almost as good as you.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
You're crazy.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Jack.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Jack, I --
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Au contraire, mon cher.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
I know, I know.
Right.
I can't feel my body.
I promise.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Just tell us what you can --
How'd you ever get away with it?
Sure!
I'll join you later.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Baloney!
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Isn't that interesting?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Where's Lother?
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Sure!  Excuse me.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--
Very much--
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
At seven-thirty?
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
You can live that down, can't you?
Make it five.
I'll be waiting on deck.
I thought you were a smart guy.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
I'll take one. 
What is it?
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Much better--thank you--
Think again--
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
I should say not.
What's that?
Sure.
Back is in New York.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Knots!
That's fine.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Somebody's got to do it--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Eh?... Oh.
About twelve hundred.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Then why did you run away?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Absolutely nothing.
Not now.  I don't have time.
You retired, too?
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Enough?  Never.
Better.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
But Doc-
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
What?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
I know.  Me neither.
Never even heard of anything like it.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Fortuitous even.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
All right, well, good night.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
But this time they'll be ready.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
You're on.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Sure...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
And still not a thing to watch.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
What about the gold?
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
I appreciate your time -
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
- Four wheel drive?
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Do you?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Well... If you insist.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Sabotage?
Stop it!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
My timing always was lousy.
Approaching the first gate.
It's Bond!
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Will the cruise set it off?
We got the same thing.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Well, I would appreciate that.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
That's nice.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
I already have, my dear.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Go away.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
But why would Andy want me?
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
What's with him?
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
I got dibs on his hat!
Heh-heh.
How 'bout three out of five?
Murderer!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Have you been replaced?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Last present!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Uh-oh.

Huh?
No, Slink --
Excuse me.
I did like the music.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Get away from me...
Go away.
You're not so old yourself!
I finished it off.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Can you move over a wee bit?
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
Did you now.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
So did I.
You're late for breakfast.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, this is crazy.
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Why?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
Caroline --
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long's the job?
Sixteen
I'm third in my class.
What is this, like freebase?
She ain't in on it.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Yeah.
Who?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
I feel like a traitor.
Only if he can be trusted.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
What do you look for?
Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Bit fucking late, like.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Easy for you to say.
Certainly not.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Smells like it.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No.
Aye.
Yeah.
Right.
And you might get the fucking job.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
OK, so who was it, then?
Roald Dahl.
Despite the Academy award?
What?
It was just an idea.
We're two thousand short.
Are you serious?
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Stick it on my tab.
Yeah.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
That's fair enough.
So what's it going to be?
What?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Rescued at last.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
It's all I have.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Damn.  Let's go.
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
He did have pointed ears.
"c."... "k."
It must be all those marsh melons.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I'll take you to the bridge.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
No conditions.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
No. You must kill me.
I hide no pain.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
I know, I met him.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
That Dillinger's on to him.
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
Wrote the...?
How about you?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How 'bout yourself?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
We have to talk.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
You're getting out of the business?
Strategic Air Command.
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
End of line.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Where are you off to young lady?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
In the helicopter.
I thought you moved out.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Okay.  Here she comes.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
You want me to just hang-- ?
It can't be.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Sorry.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes sir.
Yes what?
Oral hygiene?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
They must've just missed me.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
He needed my help.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Answer the question--
I'm not wearing any.
Yup.										*
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
So what's your angle?
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Get going! 
Go ahead.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Yes.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Yes.  Now go.
We're going to Paris?
Hello, Alabama.
Knock wood.
You can't have just one.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Don't eat anything.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What time is it?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
What's your favorite color?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
What?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Thank you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
How come?
Cancoon.
Heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
He don't got no right to live.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You goin' out?
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Where?
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
What are we gonna see?
What department?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I can see what you mean.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
No shit?
I got some money I can give you -
Sure.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Step inside.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Uh-huh.
I believe he believes him.
You're no longer an extra -
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
What can I do?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
No.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
What are you going to do with us?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
You wouldn't understand.
It's so clean.  No germs.
This is April, right?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
Hey, man...
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
Yeah, yeah.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
It will.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
One way.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Harlin around?
Yep.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You believe that?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I . . .
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Wrong number.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What happened to your hand?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
You're welcome, Grace.
I guess it must.
I have ideas.
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
You live pretty good.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What was I supposed to do?
There has to be!
We're going all the way.  Together.
What about him?
Where are you going?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
You heard me.  Count it out.
But you said we could be together.
I'm here.
What for?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Would I what?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I was hoping we could talk.
I did?
You're talking like a mad man.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How do you put a price on murder?
I need thirteen.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
You came to take my wife from me?
That's a thick change of heart.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not talking sense.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She's dead.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Will you shut up!
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Give it to me!
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Jesus!
Not as bad as it looks.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Sure, Sheriff.
You want something, old man?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
What do you want for free?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You know I won't be seeing you.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Give it to me!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
That's a solid name.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
No!
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What are you talking about!
What?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
How old are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
So?
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
How much!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Open up!
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No! No police.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
No trouble at all, really.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Come here.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Walk away.
Nothing.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
No baby, you got it wrong.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
No! No! Please!
There's someone in the house.
Like you helped her, Jake?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Wow.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Oh.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
You use your sleeve.
Yes.
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
It's finished. I won.
Seventy-five percent.
In college. A car accident.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
You're skill.
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I won't make any noise.
I'll help you.
No.
That's great.
Know what?
How long have you been married?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Thank God.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Nope.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Oh.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Is... is it... loaded?
Did you... kill him?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well, how about it?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You sure you ain't armed?
Yeah.
Yeah?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Beats the hell out of me.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
He's dead, Bill.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Two more hogs got the fever.
The Kid, yeah...
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
We'll bury him.
Just like that?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
Bear with me here...
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Goddamnit.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They ruined me tonight.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
If you'll just let me -
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Who's Keyser Soze?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
You know damn well, dead-man.
We'll see.
We want to meet him.
You know damn well what I think.
I know he was good.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Wait a minute.
I don't.
I never heard of him.
Because he was my friend.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You think he's..?
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Yes.
Nothing.
As far as we know, nothing.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Gruber...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
What does it mean?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
... that's all right.
Hold on a second.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes.  I wrote it.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I've got nothing to say to you.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Yes.  Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
You're talking like a drunk.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
I...
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
I have to talk to you.
...I'm going to need your help...
Oh shit, what's today?
You use their witness.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
The 'History'...?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
She did?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Hi.  How are you doing?
Yes.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
But you knew about this.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
What for? Who are you?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Why?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
Why?!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy --
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh, yeah. There.
I need you.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
No.
Oh! Yes! Here!
Some people prefer it.
What?
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
The tall trees...
Long ago...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
You can't.
Yes.
Yes... you run this hotel.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Would you please go and look?
More than you think.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Uh-huh!
That's following a train of thought.
How?
That!?!
Yeah.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Oh?
Oh?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Wandering.
What is it, a still life?
How soon can it be altered?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
What?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
I don't have to...
You're pathetic.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
That is absolutely not true.
At the seven-eleven.
They won't figure it out.
There is no candy!
I know and I'm honored...
There's more.
So who's the lucky guy?
The groom?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
I'm not talking to you?
Who's up for making some real money?
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Good God...Good God...
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He's having a problem here.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What are you going to do?
I don't know...
Yeah.
Hear what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm serious.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You will not screw this up.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
I love you.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Right before the wedding?
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What are you talking about?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's quiet.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I've seen it on television.
With all my heart.
I will.
I love you.
Not yet.
What are you doing?
I'm mad at you.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Well, can you come back inside?
Are they fighting?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
About what?
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Downstairs in the closet.
My God...
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's what I'm thinking.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
That's our plan.
Drum banging real times.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How could anybody behave like that?
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must listen to me before you go.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Why?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Leave him alone.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Things seem to be getting better.
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
This louse is looking for trouble.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Their weapons missing?
Then I guess we're even.
On my life, I promise you I will.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Not from in here.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
He hears...everything.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
It was me, what?
All my work is my finest.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
I'm doing the best I can!
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
I couldn't tell you.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
It's <u>producing</u>.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...twelve years.
...and...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What's it gonna cost? 
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
...I just hope...
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
The War is Over.
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
Fine. 
Could we have you in here, please...7
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
...we own it?
Where is he?
Heavy weather East of here.
I have a question for you.
I have.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...uh ... No, that's...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
I saw it on TV.
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
...that's right.
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Why not?
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
A beret.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...for the beans, yes...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Start unloading.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
He never told me...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
What? How do you know about my father?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
...Gordon.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
How much is enough Gordon?
Gordon.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Break it.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
And what do you want?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Oh Christ!
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Hi
Thank you
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
What?  Tony and China, together?
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
A little?
Who's is all this?
Hi there Sarah
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well divide 18 into three
Sell my soul?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Hey.
No, he wouldn't.
So much.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Mm-hmm.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Nope.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
What do you think?  Guess.
You were in an accident?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Who?  Your husband?
I can't, no, no, I can't...
This fence...it's so...
Wait!  Don't go...
Thank you.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
Yeah.
It's fine.
She never mentioned her father.
I should be going anyway.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Stop.
Do we have to?
She's making this up.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
What?
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
I don't know.
Jody, wait.
I think so
Did I?
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Like what?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I don't know...
Norman Spencer.
It's Saturday.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
I know.
To make sure she's all right.
But what if something happens?
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Oh, no...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
No.  Look!  In the window.
What am I looking at?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Harvey says he's amazing.
We had a seance.
But then you've been so much better...
Claire, please...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
What's the matter?
Since when?
What?
So you fucked a student?!
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
Huh.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
It wes a dream...!
ENOUGH!!!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Always loved you..
I bring her flowers too.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
- a witch.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Let's see.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Dropped it.
Mm-hmm...
- we made a fire.
Lock the door.  Lock it
What were you talking about...?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
The one on the left - definitely...
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That's right...
The touch?
I think I will pass...
Yes, one and a half please.
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
Where do you kill them...
I don't want to talk about it -
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Then make it stop...
Nothing could be better...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
You killed my friend!
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You heard me - keep away from him
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
What's this all about?
At home alone - where were you?
Oh...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
You and your pep talks.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Astronomical.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Perv.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
Dead?
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Yeah?
So that's a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We miss you. We miss our son.
It's my private business! Mine!
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
It's okay. You need me?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Everything.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I understand.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
You want it in writing?
I didn't forget.
I have absolutely no intention--
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I'm trying to help.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Interesting.
You never know around here.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Your dad taught you everything.
I know.
Well? Where the hell are you?
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
But how would we pay our bills?
Forget the store. Think big.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Really? You'd do that for me?
That's perfect.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I... You know... I...
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
She still work there?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Lombardo's settlement?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
I net a guy in a bar.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
You have someplace to be?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
What was that?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
No!
What brain?
Curiosity, I guess.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You're out of your mind.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Whichever one I want.
No you don't.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
About six and a half million dollars.
That's not your line.
What's that supposed to mean?
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You can't...
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Story's the same, Detective...
That's right.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Funny.  So am I.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
What about the explosive?
Prepare what?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Thank you.
Where have you been?
In the next two minutes?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I don't like to lose, either.
You bring the best out in a man.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Then come with us.
Let's go.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
I don't know.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I thought you had her!
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
That's all I ever wanted!
The limitless power of...
Me!
His will.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
John, why?...
Yes, sir.
You don't say.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Sure have, Sam.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Move! Or you die right here!
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm going this morning.
A real fireball.
I know.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Say again?
Yes.
His name is John Book.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
They don't have any shit.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
No... No. It is just the English way.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If she...
You'll be hist...
Oh!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Why --
No, they won't - honestly.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Oh, no -- no!
Stop her!
Did you say something?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
The nerve.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
But why?  Why?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Ohhhh --
Ohhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
What?
Oh --
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Leave her alone!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It did?
Who at?
What's the matter?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Yeah!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Hold still - hold still --
Whozat?
Don't push!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Yes.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh --
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Help!
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra would control it all.
She’s not a girl anymore.
Renard.
The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I know.
...you should rest.
No. You’ll be safe here.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
I think you do.
He used your exact words.
You turned Renard.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
A rope!
Where?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
Could...could you come?
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Washington?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
God isn't there to do it.
Hello, Adrian.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The missing scientists.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Memory lane.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What do you mean, frame-up?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Yes it does.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Naturally.
What do you get if you finish?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
What are you talking about?
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
We'll have to go after them.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
You can't talk to it?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
That's would be me.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Is this what you're looking for?
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
For what purpose?
I don't like him being here.
We have to find Magneto.
Into the Hudson?
Were you now?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
If she held on any longer she could have.
What do you want with him?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
The way what is going to be?
I know.
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, my dear, he is.
No!
Victor Frankenstein.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
I did, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Goodbye, darling.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Will there be anything else?
Fron kon steen!
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
What hump?
Why are you talking like that?
Could be worse!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Wait till he sees the bill.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Act casual!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Well...
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
I thought it was wonderful.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
I think so.
Good night!
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
