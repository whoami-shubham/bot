Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Well, no...
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But
Let go!
What if she never starts dating?
Daddy, I --
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So -- which Dakota you from?
How many people were in your old school?
That girl -- I --
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
You need money to take a girl out
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William didn't even go to high school
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
No, you weren't
Put your right foot there --
The Partridge Family?
A soft side? Who knew?
State trooper?
The duck?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No, I won't go with you
Wait I...
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Which parts?
Bianca did what?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
You think?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
You were right. She's still pissed.
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
I haven't given you much of a life.
She said yes.
Can't you stay with us a little?
I want to go with you!
I have to explore the mainland.
Father...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
What are you saying?
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
Do they have such thoughts?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
What do you read?
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
What about back home?
Are you alright?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Sorry...PD only.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
I don't even watch TV.
I'll let you know what happens.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Alright.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Stop it.
Okay.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Two weeks.
In here, says he wants a million.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
What?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
I can get you a job.
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I'm here for movies.
I'll take him.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Hal?
I guess not.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
CONINUED
Are you coming to my party?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
That's right.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Five by five, Frank.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Hey, what about me?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
You're gonna help us take him.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
No way to start a partnership.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Well?
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Half a million.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Where's luther?
Why?
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Thanks.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Doesn't look like it.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
What am I wanted for?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Call me later.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Three more hours...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hard man to live with.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
How ya doin'?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Surprise, Luther.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...would you like a drink?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Leeloo's in trouble?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I don't have time... I need to know.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
...Hi.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Apipoussan?
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
...Like love...
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
This is all that survived?
Have you identified it?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
Wait or act.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What?
Anything harder?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
That's five thousand dollars.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Celebrity Films.
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
You got absolute zero.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
You're making me very angry.
Big date tonight?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
... Hello... ?
A daughter.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm not positive this means anything.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Hello?
Yes... ?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
What was she running from?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Are you religious?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Her belongings?
Alice, you think you can leave?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I'm sure they're around.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Then you saw him, too?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Hey, Rick!
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Excuse us, dear.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Mommy...?
About him?
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
You think that's the place she's buried?
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Mark, are you okay?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Vomit?
It's okay.
Unidentified Flying Objects.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
I think you're right.
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
All ready?
Right <u>at</u> him?
But - what can we accomplish?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
He did!
Why?
See what?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
What are you boys up to?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Yes.
You see it?
Guaranteed, eh?
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Where'd you get the blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Was it funny?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Jesus, why?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Pop?
What do you want, then?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Want to buy?
We should talk.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
I still don't understand --
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Take care, Wade.
The other guy.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Call it what you want.
No shit.
The night before the shooting.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
What about Margie?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How you doing, sweetie?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
But they start executing hostages in
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Why?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
*                     Please tell me your name.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
May I speak to you for a moment?
The fax machines.
The fax machines.
Where's my family?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine.
Elaine!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Can't you take a guess?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Rats! I've lost number three.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We'd better get back now.
Airsick?
Oh, I can't stand it.
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Nothing?
What is this?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Back off, George.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
How potent?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Ripley...
Is she...?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
Yes, Hicks?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
So what do I tell this guy?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
No, it's different, honey.
Mommy...Mommy?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is she a good fuck?
Hardly.
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
There's a young girl to see you.
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
These are originals?
Alone.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Why you?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
This is not his handwriting.
Be careful!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Just one year.
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
A-flat, Majesty.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
No, really!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Where?
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
No.
I'm afraid I am.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
How fortunate.
But what is it they don't like?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Did my work please you?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Who?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Do you believe in it?
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
With the tenors.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
What do you want?
I do not seek forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
What?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Go about your duties.
What exactly did he call out?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
He's here.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Do you like it?
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I'm a werewolf.
My friend Jack was just here.
Bathroom.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Hello, Benjamin.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
Miss Price.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Hello.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Jack, we'd better go.
What the hell was that all about?
What do you think was wrong?
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
It sounds far away.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm going completely crazy.
What?!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Because this must be stopped.
What here?
Do you have any hot soup?
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
I don't rightly know, sir.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
No kidding?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Doesn't that come next?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
The theatre?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Good morning.
Why - well, I—
Oh!
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Absolutely.
He's at a board meeting.
I'm afraid so.
No.
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
The ten dollars.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
They must have turned him down.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
What time did you get in?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
This is healing?
We got a problem here, brother?
This is the best score yet.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
How?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Beautiful.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you, cousin.
Cannon or Gatling?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
The safe. Now.
What?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What do you say, sir?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
That would have made an impression.
Web's dead.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
We're drunk.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Uncle Frank?
How much of that story is true?
Doc Mimms will --
You shouldn't be up.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
I beg your pardon?
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Mmm.
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Really?
Not at all.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
This is him.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Yes?
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
J&B. Straight.
Are we here?
This is Dorsia?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Yes, darling?
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're really serious, aren't you?
You're inhuman.
Because he dated her.
Are you my two o'clock?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
What...is...it?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Dorsia.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Want a bite?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Yeah.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Have you consulted a psychic?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
So...you hang out here a lot?
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Is it over?
You are a fanatic.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Look at this.
Great!
You look beautiful.
...What?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Milo?
Milo?
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
What?!
That's gotta kill him, right?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
'Think I should buy some originals?
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
It scales, don't you think?
You could've handwritten it.
What'd the girl say?
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
What?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
I snuck into #21.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
...Milo?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
...You got my E-mail?
Did you tell Alice?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
When do I begin?
Be careful.
Yes?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Be careful.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Hello, luv.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Everything seems to be in order.
Noooooooooooooo!
Shut up.
Commander, I have to log it...
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
What is it now?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
We don't judge here.
Really?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Nature ...
May I help you, madam ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Such as?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Strange.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
I must say, you look more your old self --
What on earth?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
You're playing games.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
What's that you're wearing?
Trubshaw again? What now?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Where's Mother?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Why?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
You with Mother or Father?
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
You're kidding.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
God, you're a slob.
What are we having?
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Great bathing suit.
That's it, prick lips.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Is that all the coke in the place?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I'd love that.
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
You've been having strange sex...!
Where'd she go?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
What the hell is that?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- Knock it off!
You gotta let me finish --
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
I saw it.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
How do you know?
I work for city hall.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
Hi.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What is --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
What'll you do?
I'll see ya around, huh?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Oh Jesus Christ...
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
-- Shhh.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Then who wrote the report?
So what do you want me to do?
Brian?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He treats you okay?
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Shadow.
You don't know him.
-- Burn them.
Alderman Swayzak.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
What's that?
What's wrong with him?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You can walk away.  We both can.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
But the line has to be drawn.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
How did you know?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You lost me.
What point is that?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Hello.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Who's side are you on?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
No joke.  Serious.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Peerless, your father called.
Regardless, he still is your father.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Let Myrna finish.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...not that time...
Around...
...then what about...
I fell out of my bed last night.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I feel a song a comin' on.
The good stuff.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
How did you get this gig?
Don't try to change to the subject.
I know I won't be your puppet.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Not one.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
As much as possible?
Does this assignment interest you?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Papa?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
Did -- did you --
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
West was one thing, but this --
Yeah, right...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Where's the cabin?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
So you killed him?
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Is it the truth?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
That bad?
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Why do you care?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Buttfucks the cabin?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Four --
What are you doing out here?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Pike and I got separated --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
We just want --
Pike never confessed.
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
What the fuck happened to you --
Thank God...
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You think he did it?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How would you describe him?
Did you see that woman?
Helping people makes me happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Hi. How are you feeling?
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
I'm sorry.
Oh. Oh.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
How did you get here?
How is he?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
You first.
You know what for.
What's this?
What?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Hello.
Sorry. You've lost me...
And...
Right.
So?
She says she has a secret to tell.
I...
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't hate you.
And? What are you saying?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
I got what I paid for.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
What happened between you and the blonde?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What?
I don't want anyone to die.
Something else.
Whatever.
Why?
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
Lazarus?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
I bet you have loyal customers.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
What do you need?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
For your hands?
Still need a lift?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
I keep the heat on.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Where's Ronnie?
Let me say somethin' first...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
You some kind'a pervert?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Still makin' jokes?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Where you gonna be?
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
How a girl get like that?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Keep the change on that.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I just wanted some make-up.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
You got any money?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I've continued working on the case!
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
Nick, you can't do this.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
How many men?
Joyce?
I'm sorry.
Louder, pal, louder.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's the wife?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
She's such a long way home for you.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
If I say no?
Good.
What's the point?
One man.  He must be good.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Would you like to be modified?
What's the problem?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I think, therefore I am.
Yeah.
How do I stop one?
What about a summary then.
I think I have no money.
How long you had these guys?
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
It's a good job.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
In your opinion.
I've already got more help than I need.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Well?
How many questions did it take?
She didn't know?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
What's your name?
You want to go home?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I'm hungry, J.F.
You look... better.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You're kidding!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
Please excuse this interruption.
Get out of here!
Where are we going?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
Right.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
And that's it?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
It's Perry!
How's that?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Thank-Q!
Watching television in color.
See, ya.
Thank you.
Yes.
It didn't used to be that way.
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
In the house?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
I certainly do!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
You wanted to see me!
Adam?!
I'm leaving, too.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
No.
Are you all right?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
Like a painting?
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
That's what everybody believes?
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Right on the button.
That's right?
Who use to own it?
That would knock my father out.
Yes. He likes windows.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Why did you park way back there?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
The sky?  Where?
I don't see anything!
Say what?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Elbows, Son.
Yes?
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
Oh, my God!
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Well, put it down and come in!
You hear that?!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
What's that noise?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
What did you wish for, Adam?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
I don't know.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
To bed?
Where did he get all that information?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Gay.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I don't know. I like to think so.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Do you like talk like that?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
Oh shit.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Falling.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
You like to open me, don't you?
Come on Dorothy.
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Yes.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello, baby.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Yeah?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Good to see you, son.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
OK.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You like mysteries that much?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
You want to dance?
Probably not. No. Why?
Sandy?
Up where?
Hey, I just...
I need Il Duce.
Lord's name.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What? What is it?
They got nothing.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Hello.
Yeah, we promise.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
What are you going to do?
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
Yeah?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
What the...?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
What are you serious?
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
You bet your ass he will.
Hello? You there?
Yes.
Forgive me father.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
This is he?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
There's another stocker, right?
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
She's from Cuba.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I think we better go home.
I had to give some to Inez.
That's what she is!
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
What time did he say to be here?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Mark that down.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah. As a girl.
Freeze!
Where's Kumar?
What are you talking about?
There's not enough time.
You're living on a sailboat?
So how is it in there? 
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Did Dignan take the test?
This is good.
Absolutely.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Why not?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
You OK, Bob?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Well, what do you think?
They are.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Where'd she go?
That's my responsibility.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Did we get it?
Bob, will you please listen?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Is he chasing us?
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Everything OK?
What's wrong with Applejack?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
Ground defense.
Is he in?
Is he good?
What's the story?
He left his sweater.
Is that your chiquita?
You a good pool player.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Excuse me.
Berlin!
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Sorry to wake you.
What?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Had to be done.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Who else knows about this?
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
You still should've moved.
So why didn't you kill me then?
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
But you're sure?
-- it's just him? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I did.
I know it's a dream.
See that tram coming around the corner?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
So when was I here?
It's me.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Where am I?
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
What are they doing?
But... what will you do?
Peace?!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
No, M'lord.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
We must run in different directions!
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You've been here before?
I want... to marry you!
I'm not just saying it!
Tonight then.
Then when?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
We can't stop!
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Why? What for?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
What does that mean for Evan?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Ha! Where's that?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
I don't get it.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
What time is it?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Come on, go on...
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Meant no offense.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
I should have known.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Yes, I'll bet.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Go back to Bulgaria.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Er, goodbye, sir.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Do you know where they are?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
A franc for your thoughts.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Yes?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Hello, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Yes?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Had a close one, eh?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I believe you have a message for him?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Victor Laszlo.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, it's my party.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Save some for tomorrow.
Can't.  Need water.
Thirsty.
No.
Get water!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
That about sums it up.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
If you say you are.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Kamal is not here.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Forget it.
You're fucking dead!
Hello.
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
Take your time.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He'll need clothes... some money...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
I mean your parents.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What'd she die of?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I've never seen a lobster.
I better go.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
What's the *medical* explanation?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
I *know* this was right.
*What* will be okay?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
How is that Wally doing?
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I'm okay--I can walk.
I love you, Wally.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
But did you know him?
Did you bite it?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
What business is you in, Homer?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I'm not in trouble.
You're not yet three months, are you?
But you don't look very happy.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
This has to happen fast.
Let's just slow down for a second...
I can see why you liked her.
Nice.
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
We were back on.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Masters of our own destiny.
How much we going after?
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
You'll be there?
So that's it...
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Attractive girl.
What -- What do we do?
What the hell's his problem?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Your mess.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Sorry. What?
Pretty much.
Ten percent.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Did he buy it?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'll take you up on that.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
The Indian rope-trick.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Good night?
Where did you get it?
I had training. In the Republic.
What's the time?
You're shaking. What is it?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Really?
Why did you take the money?
Great.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
Oh hello.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
How did you hurt your hand?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I owe a lot of money.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Yes.
And your hand too.
Hello...
How are you?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
What are you, a cop?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
What happened to Bella?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
Why four? And not three or five?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Girlfriend?
Yeah.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is the key?
Fuck that shit.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Exactly.
And you can only do it once, right?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I need a diameter approximation.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Oh yeah?
What's that, sir?
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
Who are you?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Can I say something in my defense?
How're ya doin', Max.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Why would I be pissed?
Lemme put some clothes on.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll make it worth your while.
Damn... Are you alright?
I know.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
No...
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Is the social studies class over for today?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Your basic hodge-podge.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
What's this?
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Know where I can find her?
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
No.
Gotta go.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
Who are you?
Make the call.
She's got my word.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Hey, Sketchy--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
For a change.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Jeremiah?
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What are you, high?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Uh... dudes?
I found the Volvo.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Could be.
Dude, this is all I got.
Jam, listen up.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Is that your final answer?
What was his name?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
How can you do that?
I want to show you something.
Hey...
You're weird.
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
They suspended me for two days.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Hey.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Come with me.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
What's "Cellar Door"?
What is her name?
How are things going at school?
Who is the boss?
Can anyone else see him?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Nothing.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
I think now that he might...
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
How much are they paying you to be here?
He was a year ahead of us?
Excuse me?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
What're you doin' here?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
We was robbed.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
I'm a mirror.
That bitch from...
The bitch.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Oh! What is it?
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
And wear a crown and everything.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Here I am, Father...
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Father...
Who to?
Yes -- why?
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Half watch dog?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
My card.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
That's even a greater honor.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
They have noble faces.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What are you going to do?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Good morning, Treves.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Oh yes?
...everyone has been very kind.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Romance!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Is he... dying then?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
John... Merrick
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
You look splendid, John.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
My home.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
A dressing bag?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's your fantasy...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
WHY?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
You're as bad as my father.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Do you believe I love you?
The second note.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
How do we know this is the way?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
But you don't want to hear it.
Is there something the matter with it?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why should you care?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Let's hack her to pieces.
We're missing all the fun...
I... I... KILLED her...
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Faster!
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
That's better.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I AM one, Dad!
Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Vanish into thin air?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Who's that?
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Well, of course he is!
There is nothing we can do...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
And something to sharpen them with?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Thanks, guys.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Ms. Kruczynski?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
It's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
You like that?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
More?
Oh?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
You remember what happened next?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Do you remember what we talked about?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I dropped you off after. You said --
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
Yeah?
Well, you're married.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Bye, Joel.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I just got in.
It was snowing.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Yours?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
I don't know! I just said that!
Howard, your one o'clock.
Okay, we're back in.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Stan? What's going on?
I tried that already.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
What was that?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
You don't?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
That's Jellybean!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
How does she like what in bed?
What are you doing?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Thanks.
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Ballast.
The containment, Second Containment...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Justin, finish your sweep.
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
What about my ship?
What are you talking about?
What are you?
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
It is now.  We're locked in.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
We have to do something, oh God...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
You can't do that.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What is it?
Claire is your wife?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
How'd you know it was me?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Where is Reed?
What do you want, Vic?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
How long was I out?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Sweet.
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
For science.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
I can... make it work.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
It's just business.
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Please don't make this personal --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I'm just guessing.
Does Mom know you have company?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Any problems?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Pick a suit.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Did you go home and get it?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
How've you been?
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
My brother's car!
Don't you like him?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
So what did you do?
Do you think guys find that attractive?
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
How long does Doug take?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
But what are you going to do?
Dartmouth?!
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
You better save some for me, you swine!
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Do you know what you want?
I don't know.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What about the notes?
Really?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naked!?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Where's the medicine?
How long do I have?
Shoot it.
What are you talking about?
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What tape?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Jesus.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We'll meet in three hours?
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Wha?
You got something better?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And that's how I ended up here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Ohhh.
What now, Geronimo?
Your parents of relation?
How are you holding up?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Um-hmmm.
How much you got to see the show?
What's going on between you two?
How many?
I'll go with ya.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Bullshit.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Shit!
Hurry!
COME ON!
Let's wait it out.
Go! Go!
Oh my God... What is that?
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Frances?  Oh no.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I guess so, sir.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Madam...?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What does Clifford say?
There've been some calls.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
...I see.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Of course.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Kurt!
Name?
Age?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Just one minute...
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Evening, gorgeous.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Pretty morning.
Where you goin'?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I live here.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
But they're using you!
It's okay.
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
No!
You're not going anywhere!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Yes...?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke!
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Symington says...
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Friend?
Must've been a terrible row.
Are you all right?
Have you seen Willie?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Father's so proud.
I've loved you all my life
Our decision. Together.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I am not mad.
They just caught the man who did it.
You can't. Death is God's will!
That's blasphemy!
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Quite a place.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Philosophical?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
I heard.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Melvin Belli.
Good night, Alice.
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Where?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Sure.
Claudette...
Somebody's there, Barry.
You saved my life.
Thanks.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
What hath God wrought?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
You okay?
Good luck.
How many with you?
Twenty-eight.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
You don't believe in suicide.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Who's this?
Was? As in not anymore?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
Now, is your shit together?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Did he...?
What's this stuff?
I promise.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
I promise.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Mexico.
I'm sorry.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your sink --
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
He says you were scratching.
What the fuck was that about?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have a waterbed?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
This isn't gonna work.
They're gonna search the van.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
How?
You could take their head off.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Who's...  Lieuten --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Of course, but there's more --
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
No, sir, WHAT?
Then good night.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think we're had.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Then I suggest we start there.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
At first.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
Say again, sir?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
I just wonder how that happened.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
What?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Animal, I can't.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Your old sweetheart?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
I'm sorry about all this.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
I need you to trust me.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Don't speak, Quellek.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
God, what an ass.
About this much.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
We heard it the first time!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
You said "the Commander.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Yes but, we were wondering-
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
How did you come to that conclusion?
Systems register functional.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
I am SO SICK of being right.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
It's... I don't know.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
More to the left... Stay parallel...
It's Jason...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Clenched jaw...
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
That's it, It's go time.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Could be this.
Oh, right, sorry.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Hold course, Laredo!
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Over three hundred miles.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
Yessir.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
What's your advice, Alexander?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
The British army, sir!
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
That's right...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Martha... what?
To win this war I need an army.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Not today.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
I guess still in the locker.
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
About sixty.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
You know how to write one of these?
I need the money.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
You positive about that?
Or else what?
What?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Why would I do that?
Who the fuck are you?
Get in line, bro.
You're an investor, is that it?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Something shouldn't be there.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You mean, Leo?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
What's it called?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Just a thought.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I had to tell 'em something.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, he told me.
We talk different?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
I don't know.
I'll be right back.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
But you are interested?
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Fucker!
What day is it?
Ready?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
What other choices have we got?
Light in those passages ain't so good.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Mother fucker!
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Then why didn't they take it.
Headache, nausea, lights?
What?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
What guy?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Nope.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
You killed them.
So you killed them?
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Morning.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
How're you feeling?
Oh, man.
It's a Noaa buoy.
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
What's this?
Someone from the past.
Give up?
Yup.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Did you actually do this painting?
I...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Why not?
Hi Enid.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
What? Why?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Did you sign up yet?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
You can have that one.
What is this?
Hey - why do you have this?
There's my dad with Joanie.
What are you talking about -- who?
You're better at it.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
SHUT UP!
That was truly pathetic.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
We still have to go in there sometime.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
How about this one?
I know a party we could go to...
It's a surprise.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
You're gross.  See that guy?
He gives me a total boner!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Just some people from work...
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Who does?
Didn't they tell you?
Punk rock is over!
Go die, asshole!
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
That's five hundred dollars.
Really? Can I see it?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Yes, that would certainly do...
Wow, this is so cool...
What, are you a klansman or something?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
You can open your eyes now.
Uh... hello?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
No, of course not.
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Yeah, well... me neither...
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know.
Let me see the sick.
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Very good indeed.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I don't suppose I could watch.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
How many do you think they've killed?
The workers don't get on?
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
You like him, don't you?
Afraid of lions.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Everybody has a choice.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
I'll do it.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
So this is what you do, huh?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not even good for me.
Maybe I should call Janine.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
What is it, honey?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
So far so good.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Ready?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You got a flux and a half.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Ready?  What is it?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
That's too bad.
Uh-huh.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Do you want this body?
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
All right.  What is it?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Did you see anything?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Who?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
What happened??!!!?
What do you mean by "seen?"
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
They will.
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Ray -- Something's here.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
That's what you told me two days ago!
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
So am I.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
The Senate too?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
What the hell was all that about?
You brought the army into Rome.
This is our oil from our estates?
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
You get to come alive again in the country!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Before they leave, get gold.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Why not?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
But could you try?
We won't. Let's go inside.
What is the matter?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
With a family?
I do.
What's the matter?
Is that him over there?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
-- really incredible --
I said I think it is.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
I don't understand --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
What are you going to do now?
You won't?
Is that so? You might marry me?
Carl who?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
The day after tomorrow?
657-2036
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
You a student?
What's that?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Well here's the purse.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
Did you get a room?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
A single room or a double room?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Where is your luggage?
You don't?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
All right then.
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
What do you think?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Won't you unzip my dress?
What are you so scared of?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I want to say something first.
Benjamin?
He didn't see me.
Why don't you get it.
What?
Yes?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That you're afraid --
Can I take off my clothes now?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
Always?
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
And you were a student also.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Well how did it happen?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
I wish you'd tell me.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Drive down the block.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I say I've got it.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Oh, no.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
You believe me, don't you?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Say that again.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Benjamin -- where are you?
I don't believe it.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
How?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I don't like your tone.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Chasing around.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
And then --?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I want to be alone.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
That's a silly joke.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
Bless you...
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
All right then.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
Telegrams?
Anyone asked for me?
Oh -- but -- I --
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
No - absinthe.
Really?
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Tired?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
No.
How nice -- your daughters?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Insolent young cub!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
You're a deep one.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Madam should sleep.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
He will be on the train.
Certainly, sir.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Hi, Bobo.
No.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Whadaya say?
What's up?
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
I like those.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Why?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Going somewhere?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Myra followed you, huh?
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
What?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
The tap. What you do for a living.
He retired.
Atascadero.
And hello to you, too.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
That's natural.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
What?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
You take all your dates here. Blake?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
What the --
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Where are you going?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Then I'll get caught.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
What are you looking at?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Wait.
Better her than me.
He do that to you?
Is Tim there?
What if your parents come home?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Miss me, baby?
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I wanted to apologize.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
You're my buddy.
You were about to ask a question?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
It makes life spicy.
No.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
You're supposed to get hurt!
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Play?
Dad--
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Can I help you, sir?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Not at all.
Bluh.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Harold!
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Breakfast?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
And he keeps it in his apartment?
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Why not?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Unless she has nerve.
Things.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
I feel the same way.  What next?
None.
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Hands and knees, you say?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You're too modest.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Can't do it.
It was a bitch.
For what?
What happened?
So long, you guys.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Something's made you sore.
Kid--kid--
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
I know.
Oh, Paul--
Yes, he is.
What's his name?
Mom?
That's why I'm crying.
Really?
My father!
It's fine!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Yes?
The park!
What was it?
Possibly.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Is that a fact?
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Kid--kid--
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
I'm getting angry.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
No.
Joanne?
Nah.
Where is she?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Jesus.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Neither am I.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
It's not quite the same thing.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Andy.
Hello?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
I don't know.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Where'd you hear that name?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Hey man.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where's Ratan?
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Jake.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You can fuck off, too.
Jake'll take care of me.
Was he with a girl?
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
How interesting.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
A block of ice.
What do you see?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
What do you think?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's stopped.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Don't you advance on me.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Supper for two.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Would you like a cigarette?
Is Sunshine your real name?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
And a lot of time.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Then why did you leave?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
That's right.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Yes... Yes. You look...
It's a beautiful dress...
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
O.K. Let's go.
Well... G'bye.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I need to touch it to "see"...
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
It's her choice --  She's human --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
That voice --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Myers?
What took you so long?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Goodnight, then.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Hi.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Pardon?
Please. Get back into bed.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
You're Julia, right?
Julia.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Well?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Don't you care?
What happened?
No, damn you --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
You're still blaming me.
Larry!
Are you all right?
Maybe a brandy.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
-- I'll go see.
What are you talking about?
Dead.
Well, isn't it?
First time for everything.
You know, you're very beautiful.
I'll get the doctor.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Are you O.K.?
I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
I'm afraid it's true.
I'm here.
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
Oh!
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
You gotta be kidding me.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
What did he ever do to you?
Yeah.
I wanna date a musician...
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Why not?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
That's what I said.
He's got one!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Anna Moss.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
What are you talking about?
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  Why?
Is there a difference?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Huh?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Let's not.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
Shit!
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I don't know.
I suppose so.
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Is it better?
Will you call me?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
Me?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
What do you mean?
You know, with Ray...
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Where?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
No.  Probably not.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
About what?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Which way are you going?
I'll call you.
Hi, Mom.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
I think you have more.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Would you like more tea?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Jesus Christ.
He tried to kill me last night.
Who is he?
What about me?
No.
You want me to front for you.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Yes.
What is it like?  Being you?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Afternoon.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
I'm twenty-two.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Aye.
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
It will take less effort as you learn.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
I'm your future husband, remember?
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Some think not.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
You're wrong.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Your name?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Are you sure?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Where!
Spare a chair?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
What were _you_ looking for?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Morning Mr. North
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Are you back?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
Save that for the Tribune.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Sure you can. Come on.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
He's in the insurance business.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Now you're talking!
She jumped out of the window.
Where do you think you're going?
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
When did you deliver this first?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Hildy, darling!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Walter!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Well, that about covers everything.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Boy, did you see her go?
So have we!
I'll call.
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Take your paws off me!
Where'd you get this?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
What is it?
No -- don't out me off.
We'll fix that, too. 
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Here!
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Earl, you must never do that again.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
They wouldn't take it.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's that?
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Bloody.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And what's that?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
He always knows.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
He could always make me laugh.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I agree.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Wondering what?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Perfect.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Should we stop?
Why are we stopping?
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Huh?
Ugh, what's that smell?
Oh, yeah.
So.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thank you.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
How long has it been?
I still don't.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Just back up.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
Thank you.
Grampa... watch the language.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Tell it to my daughter.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Tell him, Harold.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
What is wrong, my darling?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
My little French.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Please. I look a mess.
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
Rose, please go away.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
You do?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Oh, and the sun block?
What SPF, sweetie?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
Come on.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
So, how's it going today?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
It would just be helpful to know.
Really?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Wait!
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You bastard.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Poker's not your game.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I never saw you do anything else.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
What happened to you anyway?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fine.
How do we stand?
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I wanna walk.
You name it, we shoot it.
Well... well, now.
How do you feel?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
What time?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
What's the limit?
Okay, friend. You're on.
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Yeah? What do you do now?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
You got it all in your head?
Eddie, what's in that case?
Do you want me to go?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
You need the words?
What is it, Eddie?
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
What do you want?
Mine.
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Need some gas?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I had an awful dream.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I --
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Did you call the State Police?
What is it?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Your father asked you a question.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
You saved a lot of lives.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Not listed, huh?
Spunky?
Pops, you're a genius!
We're loose!
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
That's impossible...
With their shields down it might be possible.
How do you know?
It's doing what?
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Damn it!
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Call them back.
Can they be killed?
What do you want us to do?
Venice, Italy!
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Ah, Venice...
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Yes. Now we know.
Henry, the pen --
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Don't wander off.
This one. I think he's in here.
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
But what are you doing here?
If only I could have been with you.
They want my diary.
You did!!
No! Don't Shoot!
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Dad!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Marcus would agree with me.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
What did you get?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
The penitent man is humble before God.
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
This is your last chance.
Who are you?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
What?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
I like the service here.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What'd he say?
What do you mean -- how?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Indy! Help me!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He's afraid of something.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
Oh no -- oh no!!
What?!
A fulcrum release lever!
What is it...?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
I get it!
My name is AL.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
Who?
Your name is Al...
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
You weren't listening!
Anyone there?
What's that?
I want out.
I don't like the sound of that.
Now what.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Black suits and helmets.
Gone where?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
I'm back.
What do we do?
Holy shit!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What do I do?
What happened?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Not that tie with that coat.
Which one is she?
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
Just don't show fear.
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
You shut down your sensors.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
She's got the most beautiful...s
What do I do?
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Don't touch a thing.
What next!
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
You sure this will work?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
haka xuki.
Do it.
Aim just in front of his face.
He aready made the deal..
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
What are you doing?
JOE What abilities...?
Not that truth!
What is your name?
What kind of a deal?
You have nothing...
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Sir?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
You may not remember things.
When you do...
When you remember...
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
You'll feel better
Al?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Now you know what I know.
What did you say?
The poet...something he said...
You mean from it.
Promise you what?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who else is interested in me?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Who was?
Where we going?
How?
Why not?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
How?
Now what?
Don't worry.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Is there anything else?
Wait.
The other working.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
I don't know what he was thinking.
What was that about?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
You're exaggerating!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
You're taking "no" for an answer?
What the hell are you doing?
And what are you implying?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hey, Lowell.
Hi, baby.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Is there any more rice...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Oh, my God.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Thank you for saying that...
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Give me a break!
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
How have you liked your stay?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
How much would I get paid?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
...okay.
Hello. You there
What did you get us?
Why?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Lowell, I can't afford --
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You manipulated me into this...!
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Is that a threat?
You threatening my family, now, too?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
That's his lawyer.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
What the hell is Botox?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
My God.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
So who'd you hire?
You're vulnerable.
Is Tong older than Ming?
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
How do you know?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
No.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Yes? Marylin?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
She never particularly cared for me.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Hello Marylin.
Income tax evasion?
Sweet.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Forgery and Fraud?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
Who's she?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Mr. Massey --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
My client has ruled that out.
Ha Ha.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...arty farty!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
What do you think?
Berry spoons.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Please don't shout.
Who is he?
Fine man to fall in love with.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Are you going to see him?
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
We've done that already.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
What happened?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Of course I do. What do you mean—
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Who are you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Where is the shower?
Nope. No complaints.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Not a one.
What's the matter?
But what!
What are you thinking about?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What happened?
What'd you give him for the car?
What about money?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
I've been thinking about you.
I'm hungry.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Get out of here!
Joe, listen—
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What!
Huh?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
A trumpet?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
What's the idea?
Wife?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Five G's—or I crab the works.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Where do you live?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Street cats?
What was his voice like?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Bill.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I don't believe it!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
Who?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Honey, you all right? 
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
I know David - a strange character.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Goddamn Sam!
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
How many men are working with you on this?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
This looks pretty good on me.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Won't forget?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Uh-huh.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
She sound scared?
What's she willing to give us?
She knows it's my case?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
You don't want much, do you?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Want to hear some music?
Who is this?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
How do you get it out?
It's different with men.
Well, hello.
Catching a movie.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
You think he's got a thing for you?
You're avoiding the question.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Did you do it that night?
And is that it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
In a dress.
He's liable to shoot you.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
He's already there.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Who's side are you on?
What if I plead guilty?
We can look into that.
You ever see him sell guns?
Not really.
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
Where's the bag she gave you?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Oh, hi.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Sure.
He said he didn't know about it.
You already knew that?
You think I'm kidding?
It looks good on you.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
I understand woman, damn!
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
How the fuck they know that?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
You told them that?
That's the idea.
Can you cover that?
Drink?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Who's paging you?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Four years?
Which one?
Where were you?
I lived there for about nine months.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Thanks, Baby.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Uh-huh.
Who was that?
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
She believed you?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
How can I help you?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
I need your name and address.
House or apartment?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
It still sounds high.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
How the fuck did he find me?
She's been there since Thursday night.
Turn left.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
He's around.
I'm alive.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy!
You have an unusual hand.
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Don't go.
I am.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
What do you mean, demons?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
A bit.
I had this weird flash just then.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Jake, you need to rest.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What was that?
Jacob, what can I do?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Wait. Don't.
Ready?
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Why? What for?
What the hell are you doin'?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Help me! Help me!
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
How?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Please.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Why won't you answer me?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Jake, what is it?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
You come here often?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Push 'em back.
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Everywhere, like a plague.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
Duck fuckers?
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Bomb?
Sergeant!
Okay that hurt.
Better let me.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
How many?
Where is...?
It bought us some time.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Give me a break! What happened?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Hey.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
I couldn't save them.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Did you like it?
It's time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
Okay?!!
I'll help you in.
I...I don't know what I did...
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
You must shut down the engines.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're quicker than usual.
Jesus!
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Do I have to?
I missed you too.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
I don't understand...what does he want?
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
I'm sending you the files.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
What have you done?
Can we get through these?
My cars. And a comic book.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
This is Matt Hooper...
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Right.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
Got a pen on you?
What? What?!
What is all this stuff?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
What's that, a ship?
Quint...?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You from around here?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Look at him take it!
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
What have you got there, Lenny?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Okay, cool.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Jesus, Bleek.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Cool it.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Yeah.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Why aren't you at work?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
We definitely want it to have junk.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Cold feet.
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
What?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Then what's going on?
What...
Oh my God...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Yeah, she does.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
What?!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
What did you do?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
I'm cool.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
That's me.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What?
Happy birthday Adele.
What if they're dangerous?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Can't hurt.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Now why is that?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
I like that.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Carrie.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
What's that?
Brian I want him out of our car!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Any word from that gallery?
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
You know what else?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Why?
You thirsty?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I don't understand why you do that.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
How much you gonna take?
Casper.
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper, where is he?
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Sup then? Sup?
Sup. Sup.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Who are they?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Come dance.
I'm sorry.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Your a real philosopher.
Hello.
Telly says was up.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
I hate sucking dick!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Yep.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
Yeah.
It was... it was.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
No.
You got it on the board.
Yes you are.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What are you talking about?
You think he's dirty?
Sorry.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
What is it?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Hello, Peter.
To get your attention.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why her?
Just like who?
Have you any idea what the message is?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Yes?
Let me speak to my daughter.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
What's this?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
You might not have done it had you known.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Why did he?
Come here.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What are you doing up?
It isn't Kathy.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
You mean, no prints but hers?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
As large as castles.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Answer the question.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
That's a very personal question.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
It wasn't intentional.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Do you?
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
Why?
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
What?
I tried again and got through.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Because I know what it says.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Where is the Fortress?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
There is no other way.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
There is nothing.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
The spiral begins in the west.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
It is today?
Am I not worth returning to?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Once is enough, thank you.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Go. I command you.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Put me down, you lout!
Oh, my poor stew!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
He is the King.
What news from our friends?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
A fine match.
You know the voice.
It is the time.
She has the power of vision.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Who speaks that name!
I was beautiful then.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Do not try your trickery on me!
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Who'll I aim at?
Good! First shot!
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Where are you going?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Don't you drink?
...No...
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Is he still alive?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Your father?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
To where?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Well, hello.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
Phileas Fogg?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
In a hospital.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Good morning.
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
I really want that watch.
You're pretty drunk.
I guess I do too.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Do you want to fuck now?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
What do you mean?
Sera...
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ben?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
What was that all about?
I don't understand any of that.
Thank you, Sera.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I like it here with you.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
How'd this happen?
About ready for another drink?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
No!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Where you got in the shower.
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
You can't even imagine.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You have Stromwell.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What the hell is that for?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
So now you're -- ?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What?
Yes? Ms. Woods?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
East coast people are different.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I didn't mean --
Well, yeah, but --
Elle?
Why?!
You go?  Not watch fun?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We go out, smash 'em now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
God protect me.
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
No more... please...
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Yes?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
You come stealee tleasoo?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
It's bluebells!
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Are we here?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
By the grace of God.
What is it?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Aye!  That too.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
This is ogre's magic.
Worse than the battlefield.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
I should hope not!
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
There isn't much time!
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Sunlight.
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I was with the Princess.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
Aye... my Lord...
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
These for me?
You promised!
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
How much longer?
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
What happened?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Its powers are strong.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
I thought you were dead... I --
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
What's the matter?
Biting you?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Not very precise directions.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Exceeding fair.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
This is not the time for squabbling.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
That was in jest.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What's she doing?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
What care the bones when the soul is free?
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Is he a friend, then?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Mom?
I couldn't get it to go down.
Atonement.
I'm living here while I build another house.
I had them in my pocket.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You're a good girl.
I can't even take a shower here.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
We're not gonna do anything.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
Why is that?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I did warn you.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I'm not doing it!
I don't beg.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You're too fucking late.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Hi, Alyssa.
What are you now?
I know parts of who you are.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
Are you talking?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
And you told Mom today?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
What would you do?
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Ah!  Oh....
How many bedrooms will your house have?
It's okay.
Lock the door behind you.
He never answers.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
What?
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
The garage.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I used to live here.
Finished or unfinished?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Where's Sam?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Do you need help?
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
Been thinking?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Despite you.
That's the problem.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Do you know anything about building a house?
You're sure about this?
Adam, that's not true!
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Sharp.
Married?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Can't you remember your own name?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
What are they gonna do to us?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
You're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
This fork is filthy.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
What's up, Ray?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
I know you're not talking to me...
Why ain't his pick swinging?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
So it don't exist.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's your name?
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Is this a joke?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Where did you meet my father?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
How did you see me?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Makin' friends already.
So far, so good. Now what?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
This is bad, Nicky.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Hey...
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
What's with that guy?
You sure you're down with this?
Schnapps...
This don't look good.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You got the wrong window again, man.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
I'm a Sandman!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
That's better.  How do you want us?
What other food?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
What the hell took you so long?
Why did you do that??!!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
What's your name?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
What's wrong, Available?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
What Quad do you live in?
Where did you get that?
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I -- I can't.
Are you taking me to them?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
We can't. We're going back.
Is it inside the city?
What people?
We'll have to bury him.
I'll make the arrangements.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
What kind of place is this?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Why not?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I was here yesterday.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Hello.
Pete?
He'll kill us.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
In pornos?
You liked it.
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
What's up?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Where's Pete?
Yeah, Mack?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Do you remember?
He's not Madison?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
So?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Give that a try.
At sixty?
Hello.
Mr. Eddy?
I missed you.
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Sheila?!
I didn't know you cared.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Two years!?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
He might have lost his way.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
If you want me to!
Where is your mad pilot?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Who?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Charming, isn't she?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
What do you want?
No porters here!!
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray!
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Well - I mean—
Let me up! Let me up!
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
was saying—
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Ouch!
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
What do you want him to do?
Thank you.
You shot an eight year old girl.
You think we're nuts.
I wasn't scared...
Helluva night, isn't it?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
We'll take it from here.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Kay--
How does that help me?
Would you call this a code 100?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
So... how'd you hear about this?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Found it.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Yeah?  What's up?
How'd you know?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
Wally!
Take it.
Drop some money.
Oh, God...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
-- but he didn't.
From where?  D.C.?
You set your patients on fire!
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
John --
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
To them.
If it's a question of authority.
But you call this room the "temple".
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She was looking right at me.
Are these all of her previsions?
She's a precog?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I won!
Sean, wait...
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
You're not gonna kill me?
Something wrong?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
What's so funny?
Why?
You said they're destroyed.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
How do I even know which one has it?
John?
This is all my fault.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
I understand.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Congratulations, sir.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Good God.  What was that?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
What about your meeting?
Howard --
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Cream and sugar.
No.
Since right after we lost our son.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
You sure? I just made it.
Thank you very much, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
Thank you, sir.
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Hello.
No.
So, what kind of gig is this?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
You talk to Max today?
I want you to quit.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Goodbye, Bobby.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Where is this happening?
Heard of them.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
A million. Easy.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yes.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
No. Just the cross streets.
How am I being shitty?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
We need guns.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
What? Did she say something?
I'll get the girl.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yeah. What vibe?
You fucking nuts?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Nothing, man.
Let's check out the penguins.
The penguin house.
We need guns.
Float me a hundred bucks.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
I'm sorry...
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
No. I'll wait here.
C'mon...
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Excuse me.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Don't drag my ass into this --
Stop.
I'm half Irish.
No shit?
Coke?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
No, really, mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Ricky.
Yeah.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
Sure. You boys want anything?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yeah.
What about my keys?
Don't worry. I get it.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
No...
The Red Dragon.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Why?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I'll give you back the 600.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Man, what do you want?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Don't con me.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I don't know how.
Do you?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Just an idle question.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm in Detroit.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Did you hear what I said?
Talk about what?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Let's cancel.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
You know that gal?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I better not come in.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Let's go.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You're my father.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You had the number.
That's a fine chick.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Head nigger in charge?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Where are you coming from?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
Where do I find you?
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[What money?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
What is it?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
How long you staying, Crease?
What are you doing here?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Creasy?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
You're fast.
Do you think he'll come back?
No.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Do you always sleep with him?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
The blocks.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
You've done much of this work before?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
You should be sleeping, baby.
I like him, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
It's early.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Hey! What are you doing here?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
When was this?
What they say?
You come up here often?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
This is the kitchen.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You got an elevator in this house?
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Hello, Ma.
What?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Sure.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
What do you want me to do?
Which hospital?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Epidural hematoma?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
What?
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Wait a second...
Is that liquor?
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I think I heard about that.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We stand behind all our work.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
He only lasted one season.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
What's the matter?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
Very happily married.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
Yes, Reverend?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
About that chest-cutter...
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Good morning, Colonel.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Never mind.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Can I help you pack?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Thank you very much for everything.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
What's the idea?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Colonel!
Have you seen him?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
What do they want?
Who's got him?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Four bits.
Sure.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
What are you doing up here then?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Apartment 306.
What's the line?
Where's the car?
Really?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Hold on a second here.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
You can't kill me like this.
Open your shirt.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
And what if you can't live with it?
McCall, you all right?
Is the hostage injured?
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
How's Paco doing?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Stay up there, Girl...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Roper.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I can't do that.
What have you promised them?
Are these yours?
This is Halden.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
It's okay.
Why?
Why --
This is how you pick up women --
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
The guests are here.
It's time to wake up.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Where the hell are you going?
How long 'till we can eject?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What?
What's her name?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
What is it?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Who did he digitize?
Not his style.
Then how do you know about --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
But I don't know anything about programming.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
And it meant something.
Access granted.  Male or female?
Standard, modern, upscale --
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Is this... food!
I heard that!
... What's happening to him?'
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
Release the power WITH the power.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Two thirty three a.m.
... Not bad.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
And how do we do that?
It's... an eagle?
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Up here, Boss.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Are you frightened?
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
We could lose the deal!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You ain't even a man yet.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
The deal's too good, Frankie
No. They envy you.
What's the matter?
Luciano.
Something came up.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Meyer just finished the books.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
How soon can we pull this off?
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
This business is about taking risks.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
He's an animal!
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
The terms will be mine.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Wanna know what I think?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Who did this?
Monkeybone?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Back? You're sending me back?
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Uh huh. And?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
What are you watching?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Dating anyone?
You know ...  ... whoops!
But I was dusting.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Mother!
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
It was?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
What's this, Diz?
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
What dame?
Oh--yeah--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
You know, we're getting married.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
The war's on!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
All right, why?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Where were you?
Will the Senator yield?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Mr. President--
Will the Senator--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Yes, Ma?
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Just fine.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
*No*!
What's your name?
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I know. It's--Violet.
Letitia.
Lena.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Ah! That's more like it! What?
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Ax?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Nice *compliment*!
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Are you married?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Were you present when all these things took place?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
What?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Now, what do you see?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Mary, I'm going home.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's the matter, hon?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
People have been crucified before.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
The guy's balmy.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Sure.
What's bothering you, huh?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
How's it going? Okay?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Relatives of old man Semple.
Nuisance value?
Miss Bennett please!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Must we have the echo?
Look!
Yes?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
You're going to New York with us.
No?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
I've got one for Cobb—
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We provide opera.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes, sir.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
A what?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Who are they?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Where is your farm?
Is she home?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
What do you think you're doing?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Me, sir?
Shall I call the police, sir?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Thank you.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What's that?
Where's your wife, Henry?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
What brought this on?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
It was Henry Follett.
...so rich?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Do you think that's a good idea?
What'd you want?
I think you do.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is this the treatment?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Hello?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
What did he want you to do?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I've got three big ones.
This is great!
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Slash what?
A doll?
Damn! What is your name?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Yes... your particular approach.
And how does one do that?
Now go find me a big stick.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What just happened?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
And what is he in prison for?
No women allowed.
Two hundred pounds.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
That's what I am to you? A contract?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
I found it, Evy! I found it
Hey,... don't I know you?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Tough break.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Do I?
He was the last time I saw him.
Much less go outside.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
How's your dad?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Come here.
Then why are you here?
I'd better go.
What?
Stay away!
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Bye. 
You're the Sphinx.
Oh don't start that again --
What are you talking about?
There's a big difference.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
But she still might call!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Maybe there was traffic.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Really?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
She likes you.
Be a Mohican.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
It's time.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Please...
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
About 5,000 troops.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
There are none here.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
And who is defending Paris?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
General Bonaparte?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Bastia -- and you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why are you carrying the dog?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, that is good.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Promise me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What?
You wrote it.
Do you know what you're saying?
Can you give me a drink, please?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
And, where did you see my portrait?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
And where do you place Alexander?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
What did you say his name was?
Is he alone?
Come in.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
No.  Thought he was with you.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Nobody!
What's crackin'?
This you?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You know what this is?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
$247.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
It works.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You make it sound so easy.
I will.  When can I come visit?
You want us to give you a ride?
Most definitely.
You did all this for me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Here I come!
What's the matter?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Are they still out there?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
He's inside the house?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Where did Craig move to?
Hey, how you get out of here.
Hey, what's going on?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Elroy, what happen?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Amtrack?
Where'd you come from?
Somebody close?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I appreciate that.
I have a problem.
How do you know that?
Who did?
What?
Can we go now?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
This says "invitation only".
What about the gun?
What...?
I killed you.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
How am I supposed to get away?
Come back.
No.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
But...
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Lynn!
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Will you promise me that?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Who?
What am I supposed to say to her?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Hey!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
That's enough.
Any trouble?
What do you figure he done with it?
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Here they come.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Uncle Birdie!
Where's Ruby?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
What could have possessed that girl!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Tell me a story, John.
To see Dad?
John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, where's your folks?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Did you hear what I said, son?
What's taking you so long about it?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right...  Come along.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have milk too?
Why, pray tell?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
What do you want?
I been bad!
You'll whip me!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
Hello?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
Meanwhile...?
Dad -- what you doing here?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Right home after.
Get into bed.
What?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
And then what happened?
Rod says the sweetest things.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
When did you have a nightmare?
What is it, Ninotchka?
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
You feel it, though.
What is it, Anna?
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
That's her.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
How are things in Moscow?
Which lawyer?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Have you?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
A week?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We may have a chance.
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
If there is anything we can do for you...
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
You want me to go in there?
Business.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
I must get into that country of yours!
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You, please.
Can I help you?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then you don't want me to go there.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Is that customary?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Room service speaking.
Not funny, huh?
You see I couldn't shout that.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
No music.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Thank you.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
The future of the common people.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Executive clemency ...
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
How much do you need?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
McCord? ...
Pay him.
No, sir, you did not.
I don't have a pistol.
Who?
That was civil war.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Well, why not?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Mr. President!
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
More light, chief?
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I never met the man.
You'll win the nomination.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
We took his system out.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
How the fuck did you know?
You're fucking me.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
No, Henry.  I don't.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
It was illegal, what he did.
The lie?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
... give me a break, Mary.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
I'll do it.  No more.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Are you okay?
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!
And what am I doing?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
You're discouraged.
No money in his room there?
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
That's the boy.
But you don't believe it.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...Be careful.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
It ain't even three years we been married.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
What's in the satchel?
I need to know that.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
You can't afford one?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
This. And the gas.
Yessir.
Now. We close now.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
One room, one night.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yessir.
What about one forty-two.
Half.
...But that won't last.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Why would he go to Odessa?
...You didn't take the product, did you?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
Did you send anyone out there?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
A woman can write a check.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Who are these idiots?
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
That's my son! My son is dead!
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
No... what about your sister?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
I gotta go.
That's very kind of you.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
You never gave us a chance...
Why do they keep calling you George?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
So, call me when you --
What was that?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Where you headed, Betty?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Guess who I saw today.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Does he know you think he's real?
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Huh?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
What do you mean?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
That's right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
What?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Who's this?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
This is Betty at twelve.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Hmm?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Hang on there -
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
How'd he know about the treasure?
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Vernon Waldrip.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
An' all my meals for free...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
It was a powerful air.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Great ass.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
You're good.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Yes I do!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Vietnam?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
God help you, Lynette!
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Do you go to school?
I vote for the motel.
There's always a choice.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
You okay?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What?
There is not one thing funny here.
You should see the look on your face.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
One.  Squeeze.
Bullshit.
The walls are steel, right?
Fuck.
They're not supposed to be here!
Who is this guy?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
They're coughing.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
And we're never getting in.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
I mean it!
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
That door is a safely hazard.
Push that button for me, will you?
Cut it back a little bit.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Makes me nervous.
Too many stairs.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What's going on?!
What?!
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Got him!
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
Call Dad!
I'm sorry.
Why?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Tyrone...
Those ain't cops.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Well... is it loaded?
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
What's up?
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Inspector Brimmer
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yes sir I was.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Ain't no one seen him.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
What unit?
We did.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
If I fail, you fail.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
What news?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
And the Governor?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
A long time ago...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
One of yours?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Not yet, Thomas.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Honey, Church will be fine.
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
I don't get it.
I'm not tired!
Ellie--
Do you swear?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
God, that's fine.
What were you listening to?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Going to tell Ellie?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
She's finally asleep.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
What's in your head, boy?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
I'll watch my back.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You have a name, missy?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
What?
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
If I had known --
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
A fool's errand.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
You would do that?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Move!
Why are brothering with that?
It's still against the law.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Is that so?
Wait -- what about the pistol?
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
On what?
No.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Jack!
No, it's not.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
What happened here?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
But --
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
... plastic.
I know what you're doing.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Consideration?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Where did he go?
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Yeah?  So what?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What are you going to do?
You were never invited to my house.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Somebody has to.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
The big house.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What are these?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Is something wrong?
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
How far can you stretch?
I could go with you.
That's pretty good.
Did you go?
Who is he?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
You're not going after Argon!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Vermin...
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
What in the hell?
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
May I use your telephone?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
What is this person doing here?
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Yeah.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
It has been alleged - yes—
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
What do you know about Conrad?
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Okay - you remember Joe—
Some bicarbonate - quick!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Found no skeletons?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
No. I want to know.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, hi ...
Bud?
No she's not.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
But where would we go?
It's six-thirty ...
Oh.  I can't.
I don't believe it.
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
I think I've got something to say.
Dan! Arrest them!
What are you doing?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Noooooo!
I don't believe this.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
JENNIFER!
Me too. Sounds swell.
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Are you sure?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What do we do?
I like calling you David.
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
... Her father.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
What?
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
What's wrong?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Dream come true, hunh?
Hey.
This is Barry.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Tell me why.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Really?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Yes.
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Hi.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where you married?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I forgot about that.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Why?
No.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
What do you mean?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
How you doin' Barry?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
What's up?
Where you been?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Ok.
As soon as you want.
Your expenses are your own.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Hello?
What did you say?
Put him through.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Madeleine --
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
You mean to take us all down with you?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I saw the longing in your eye --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
And he's never once attempted escape?
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was fiction, of course.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
How is the patient faring?
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
Most assuredly.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
"...your wife."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
-- words alone are insufficient.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
How was I to know, my darling?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Leave at once --
So you ever gonna do a picture?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Uh-huh
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
It's not really--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You are repellant when you drink.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
Keep filming.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
You drink at 10 am, do you?
I wanna see the picture today
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
Magic
Not for me.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Sigmund Freud?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Oh for Christ's sake-
Oh Christ...
Fuck you
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
I want you back
I'm sorry.
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You gonna watch?
Mank!
Shit
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
May I help you?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
You're going to destroy it
You're lying to me.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
For the title
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What who's been sayin'?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
You want me to do what?
Jack, I got no gloves.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Who's that?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah --
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
I did keep an eye...
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Nine o'clock.
You don't talk very much.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
But they don't have a case against you.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I said, let's go.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
This is Doyle's house.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Feel a little foolish?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
But I'm not a killer!
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Where?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Like what?
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Can you get me that ring back?
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
She's only perfect.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
I wonder.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Ten here.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Something big going on somewhere?
What a day I've had!
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Make the one you want.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What do you think?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
What is it you're looking for?
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
No comment.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
I hate funny exit lines.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Wasn't that close?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
L. B. Jefferies.
What's that?
Nobody chickened.
What's happening?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Will you let him tell it!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Is he there?
Come back tomorrow.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
That's swell.  How are you?
Why?
You sure?
No.
You promised to give it back.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
You don't have to be unfriendly.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm getting that way, too.
Where you going?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You can trust me, Judy.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I never felt so clean before.
After he tried to shoot you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What's he like?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
That one?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Didn't you forget something?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
I was talking to Dad.
Gabriel, you promised!
You promised me!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Saw me --
Where the hell are you going?
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
I thought we'd have a few more days.
No!
Nick, what happened --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
They'll have guns.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
No.
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
But I never said Rudy.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Be more specific.
What the fuck are you talking about.
So what the hell good are you...
They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
NO.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Get in the CAR!
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
That motherfucker --
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
How long ago was your makeover?
What the hell was that about --
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Three days, man.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Rudy, don't move --
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Do what?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That's what it looks like!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
I'll call somebody.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
What's that?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
You gonna put it away?
What's she doin' now?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
What're you talkin' about?
Follow you where?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Gun shot.
No real people?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
I got 'em, all right?
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Not these guys.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Tell them to come on in.
And this is Helen Carter.
So am I.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All my clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
I won't have you fighting over me.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Where you going?
I found their surrey --
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
How does she draw?
In a fight?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Half of them are mine.
What did you come back for?
You'll live.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
But I want to stay.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
What's the matter -- restless?
Even women?
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
We don't want to go there.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
How do you know who we are?
Clay Phillips.
We got to get movin'.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Really? That's amazing.
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Hello Brenda.
You sure?
Hey, you left your book back there.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Listen to me I --
What should we get?
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
I'm Cindy.
Hanson, please.
Both of them?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Father!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Huh?
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
I got it!
Here you go, Professor.
Would you please focus?
Professor, I think you should see this.
I can do it myself.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Father.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
What does it say?
"Ray!"
Oh, boy! 
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Hi!
Sorry, ma'am.
Because it's the rules!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
I love that you're my wife.
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
"P" as in...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Hello.
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Certainly not!
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
You scared?
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
But tell me --
What did she want?
What were you talking about?
What did she want to know?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
But I'd give a great deal to know.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
 What have you done about Irving August?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Who the devil is he?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I'm going to find your sister.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Could you find him?
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I don't know.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
And you knew he'd be here.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
But you would like to know where she is?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I didn't know.
But she was here?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Ann?
Well...
No, not really.
Oh, uh-huh.
Nine years?
Why is that?
You're what?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
No.
Like what?
You just ask them questions?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Do you talk to him?
No.
About me?
Can't.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I can't.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Like maybe a big part?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
John?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Yes. I just got busy.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Why?
Where did you go when you left here?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
You son of a bitch!!
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
What do you mean?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
What?
Lose something?
Because I never got around to it.
No!
No, it's nothing like that.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Because I wanted to.
I feel like I do.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No, I touched me.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Doing what?
You just want to ask me questions?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
When?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Hung up.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
No.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Hi.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Anything wrong?
Can I call you at the office?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Didn't seem worried about them.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
You bet, Bert.
About Brad's family?
You got it!
Infantile regression.
SIN-I-FUL
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
How did you come by this scenario?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
I'd forgotten.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
I NEED SOME
I'm...happy.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
And none of them worked?
She walks in beauty...
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Hiya.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
And?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
How old's she going to be?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
It does. Feels right.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
Have you no shame?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She what?  When?
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Later.
What'd Christine say?
Hey, there you are.
Does she know about Saturday?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Fucker hit into us.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Do you like them?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
We gotta go back.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Please, Miles, please.
Me?
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You want to join us?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Are you all right?
She got anything good?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
What's the title?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
See you, Miles. You take care.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
A hair.
Daddy.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Hi sweetie.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...Tell Graham --
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Five. The five longest.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
It's noise.
Morgan, be careful.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
Morgan?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They'll read our minds!
It's the strangest thing Father.
Is anything missing?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
Goodbye?
Are you all right?
You must have known that before you came.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
You're not Baxter?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
South of here, past Chimayo.
They got a saloon there?
Doesn't look quite fair.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
It's not going to be easy.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Daddy?
What happened?
You own this land.
That's a lie.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
This a friend of yours?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
You can't do this.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Hello, Cobb.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
You've got a legitimate job.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
What makes you say that?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Where is she?
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
-- We call them "vactors".
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Not quite how I imagined it --
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Okay, Dad.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
You know me -- married to my work.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Let's take it down a notch.
You mean they buy it?
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
No.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
That isn't magic.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
You weren't a paper champion.
Are you wigging out?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
And you know what else?
They're right here.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
You know that accident up there?
You can see her?
Where is she?
What are you thinking, Momma?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Could take a little while, though.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Bitch.
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Gene.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Curt Cobain.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
He means moon shining.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Ow!
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
How does it feel, Keith?
Is that right?
Name something.
What's wrong?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Getting ready.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Mac... let's get out of here.
I almost thought for a second...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Shit.
What?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
Pretty, ain't they?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
What's she see in that douchebag?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
Are you nodding?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Who's that?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
So tell me about yourself.
Is this fun?
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
Anything?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Jesus!!!
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Why are you stopping?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
No.
How long's this gonna take?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
You can't swear on these.
Do I have a choice?
I hate to say it...
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Talk to me.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Oh.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Maroon uniforms?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Man, that's great.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I could have it sent out...
That's probably him now...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
I can't discuss --
You're finished.
...Are you insane?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
No shit.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
What were you doin' here anyway?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
What else did Padiche say?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
What happened to Gibarian?
I want to hear your version.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
What will you say?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He has a point.
What's wrong.
But we fought.
But that's what happened before.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris --
I wish you wouldn't.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
It's terrific Win.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Right.  That's true.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Claire?
Open the door, will you?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
Stop being nuts!
I don't know you...
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Claire...
I'd miss my life...
Everyone's all right...?
You don't have to, now.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Keep what handy?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Hey.  The neighbors.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Yes.
I asked for the man in charge...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
You're here 'til what time?
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Under the table.
How are things going, pal?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
You coming in?
And Flash isn't?
Here you go, Pete.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Lizzy!
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Jesus Christ.
Now tell me you love me.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Would you cool it already?
You're making my life difficult.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Good morning, Liz.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I suppose.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Sit down and stop being such a child.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Peter?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Waldos.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Yeah, Roz.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
The record--
Absolutely no class.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Poison emergency.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Mr. Parker.
How much do you know about it?
Need any more help?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
So they're airing this tonight?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Break it off!
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
I'll live.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
You were saying --?
Jawohl!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
What do those broads say?
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
What radio?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Says me.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Who did?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
Ach so!
Wie hat er's gemacht?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
What guy?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he now?
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
What do you mean?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Population?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I get it. I get it.
Data, are you all right?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
We're within range, sir.
Do you remember him?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Captain, are you all right?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
It looks like we're too late.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Calm yourself, Bones.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Aye sir, coding now.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
I don't understand.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
What happened...?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
May I ask why...?
Yours...?!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!

Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Genesis, I want it.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
But -- why?
... He spoke of your friendship.
He asked you not to grieve...
Share this with no one.
500 Kellicams!
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Jim --
Don't tell me you've got something.
You're crazy -- !
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're still running with shields down.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
They won't --
Genesis, what's that?
Thirty seconds...
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
<u>WHY</u>?
And who is this?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
They knew just where to hit us.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
That's it?
Uh oh.
And why not?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
How?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
I can't get power, sir!
Admiral on the bridge --
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Now wait just a damn minute.
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You're joking...!
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Can you isolate the wave?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Ah, well done, team 2.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Memory problems, too.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Or believe, I'll bet.
You're upset about losing the whales.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Wanna try it from the top?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
So. There we are.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Status?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Aye, sir. Descending.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10 seconds, sir!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Hello? Computer...?
Transparent aluminum?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Deceive us?
There are days.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Why not...?
No... I want to stay with you...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
You're not finished here?
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
Did you know her?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
Jean-Luc Picard.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Cochrane?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
I'd say you already have.
You're leaving, aren't you?
Life signs?
Captain...?
Port battery, ready sir!
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Looks like they damaged the silo...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
What are they doing?
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
Someone...?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
What is it with you, anyway?
Damned clever if you ask me...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
For insubordination.
She's here - somewhere.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Course heading, Captain?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
What took you so long?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Aft thrusters -
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Surely not.
Me?
We HAVEN'T fired -
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
NO WAY!
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Can you remember our father?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Remember him?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
What do you imagine this is?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Ready, Captain.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are being hailed.
You have a red shirt.
Yes.
What is our approximate distance?
I'm going to miss you.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
I'm only half human.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
I won't do it.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Serving with you has been an honor.
And you're not as we imagined you.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
With a full head of hair.
Hello, Jean Luc.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
How long until we reach the Rift?
But surely...
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
What can I do for you folks?
I'll take that.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
What do you do?
Make any money?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Please.
What?!
What?
What?
What?
No gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
I am husband?
No.
What's the matter?
Horses.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
But I must go here.
Say it.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
What happened?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes.
Yes.
I like this music.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You liked my singing?
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Asshole!!
No one's traveling in this weather.
What are you saying?
What?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
There.
Where do you think you're going?
Tell the baby about me.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
They after you?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Tell him I'm not here.
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
To the same woman?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Bullshit politics.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
That's a good one, coming from you.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
You think Tran killed her?
Sounds good.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Looks like she was holding out.
What stuff?
Jesus.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Commissioner Strickland.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Forget her.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
And what about the guy that was following me?
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Those two guys were cops.
There's a plus side?
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
No.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Hey, Sheriff.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Dylan here.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
He was sitting here?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
Its called insubordination.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Dick Low's a killer too.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Yes I do.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Find the feet?
Jesus.
And nobody else can do that?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's quite advanced.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
What was your weakness, sir?
I don't carry it with me.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Was it Zero?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Yes, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
I'm sorry?
Thanks.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
To do what?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Well, I should be getting...
Hi. Sorry about that.
How are you doing?
You know, us.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I don't talk about her that much.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll give you an eight. 
Oh.  Where is this place?
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
They turned you down?
Then why won't she call...?
How's it going for you two?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Mike?
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
It doesn't matter...
You gotta do it.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I don't think so.
That's bullshit.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
I gotta use the phone.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
I hear she's getting real fat.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Tomorrow?
Because he's a bitch.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
It's on.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
You're money.
...Sue...
...Shut up, Sue...
Sorry man.
The bear's got his claws back.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
No.  You ask for too much.
But your daughter is still alive.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
What was that?
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Outside.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
I know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
One of Tattaglia's people?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
I've never seen anything like it.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Then the legs at the knees...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
Michael...
I LOVE YOU.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Where are you going?
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Buy me out?...
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Uncanny!
Marge, you like everybody.
Shut up.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
I'm never going back!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Could we sail to Venice?
And Rome.
What does he say?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
He's downstairs.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Why?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
What?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Yes it is.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Dickie!
Hello Marge.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
That's a terrific idea.
Tom?
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
It's all true.
Where's Dickie's father?
What's funny?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie, my God!
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You're kidding.
So -- are you travelling under R?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
What rumour?
No.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Or Tom and Peter even.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really don't want to see anybody.
A few days ago.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
Is there a firing range around?
You like ball games?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I don't know...
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Travis?
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Try holding the match like this.
Oh, are you all right?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
20 bucks?
Hello.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
That ain't much of a name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Listen...
God, you are square.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a narc?
You don't have to.
Why should it be grounded?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
So whatja do now?
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm hip.
I'm here to see Iris.
Wiz?
Don't stop...  do no stop.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
What are you doing?
Mason.  Mason?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I do?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Whoa.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
We were in love... weren't we?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Well, there's got to be a way...
They're not bad.
I see...
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
No wallet, huh?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
And... what's my name again?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Any idea how you got here, son?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Evening, Luke.
Jesus.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Cigarette?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
That was beautiful.
I can play the piano?
Sit.  Play with me.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Found me.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
That's my r-r-rent.
It's about me.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
They all know you?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
Who?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Miss Hayworth?
Cathy?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
San Francisco.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
And the second?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Mother!
Could I have a puff?
Are you coming to my party?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, but where?
And the white house?
The little girl's name.
Are you sure?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Tell him about the party.
When do you think they'll come?
Where will we go?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Then he saw.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I couldn't ask you to.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
These birds were...
He was killed last night. By birds.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Doesn't what make me...?
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
So you didn't go to school together.
What did it say?
I'd still like to see you.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Last night? What do you mean?
Some cream?
It smelled of the fire.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie, Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
What time is it?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Can we turn back?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Birds?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
She's unconscious.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
It might be an interesting case.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
What did you hear?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
But where did they get those people?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
You're not going to Gray.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
I heard you were looking for this.
Fuck. Me.
Yeah, no kidding.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
Are you ok?
It's ok, it's ok...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
But you, you've had them.
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Did all these people die in wars?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Go to the movies.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Everyone seems so-- 
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
No. That's all finished.
No -- no, thanks.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Why not?
All together?
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Where you going?
With him?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Thanks, Grandpa...
See you later.
We are...
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Something the matter?
Are you following me?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Why not?
You've got to put this on.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Star.
Sixteen.
That night?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
You can't let anybody leave!
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Torch it over there!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Garry's missing!
Not the only one.
I guess you're okay.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
What kind of test?
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Maybe it ain't coming.
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
You know of them?
We need your help.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
What?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
All right, what is it now?
Admiration?  My my.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Dance with me...
Darling.
Alex, what is it?
We took a walk three days ago.
In the future, we'll be better.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
You wouldn't believe me.
This... was my home.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
No, sir --
Yes, sir.
Where do they take them?!
You won't even try?
If I might explain, sir --
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Sir?
But... what about Starks?
Should we be...
He's recovering on the third floor.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
We are not birds of a feather.
Yes.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Did you know my father?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
What for?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
What? What are you thinking?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
Where are we going?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
And if I didn't want to come?
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
What do you mean?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
The future doesn't look different?
And how do you know that?
How do you know about Eugene?
Who...who kills me?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
You know how to get there?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
You ever been to jail?
Can you drive?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
No.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
How?
On what?
Who do you think did it?
I've been better.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
I have no problem with that.
Good God.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Did you get married real young?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Where'd y'all go?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Will you at least see how it fits?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
In case of what?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
It means shut up, Thelma.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You're not touchin' that car.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Drive!  Drive away!
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Now what?
What little dogs?
Like a Chihuahua?
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
What?
Sorry!
Ready?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
No.
You awake?
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
How far are we from Mexico?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
Where you goin'?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
No You mean...?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
So... I see you made the news.
Mary.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
We're in love with your roommate.
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
I work with retards.
A surprise?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Lint?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Mary ah, forget it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Turn it up, Magda.
All set.
You want her dead, don't you?
I think your life's about to change.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Four kids, three different guys.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
What are you doing?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Thanks for picking me up.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Oh. Well I am.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Bundt cake?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
So who you taking to the prom?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
By the way, how's he doing?
What's that?
Well... why don't you move back?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Go!
But but what about Steve?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No! I was pissing!
Eh.
How are you doing, Warren?
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Well, I'm not.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Slow down. Smell that?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
The sun came up today.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Secretary of Defense...
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
A murder. On the reservation.
What's this about?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
I did.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
What'd she say?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Why does he wanna see me?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What's that?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He's gone.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
I desecrated it?
X21. Come back.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
How so?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Two.
There you go with those moves again.
I can't.
Lieutenant...
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Anything.
It dies. We live.
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Come on.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Goose is dead.
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Well?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Ohhh Mother!
I've got it -- hold on!
Is it you?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Tom Kazansky.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
A plaque?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
Who is the best.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
It was bad.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Where's yours?
What to the rebels want?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Shut up and drive!
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
I'll go encode your room key.
But I thought...
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
I'm with an very important client.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Yeah.
They sell fake memories.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Where?
Are you saying she liked it?
He's not at ground level.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Who?
Lori...
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
All right.
I give up.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
...What?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
I said get out!
What can I do?
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I might have an idea...
You're really leaving, huh?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Oh, Jesus!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Use the fucking bomb!
Yeah...but no ties.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Down, honey, down.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Ms. Vin's sister.
Gimme back my bottle.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I noticed.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Oh really?
How can you remember that?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
What other case?
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
Eddie Dowd.
So what're we gonna do?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
No. You tell me, Shu.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
I'd l-like to answer the question.
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
I'm nearly out.
Don't get funny with me again.
We can do it right here.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
No.
No.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Take a look at this.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Call me.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
What are you doing?
You're not mad at me?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
You missed somethin', Ed.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
James...
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
You're getting warmer.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Good night, Mom.
No.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Come back as soon as you can.
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
This is going to drive the ante up.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I do. Yes.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
Mr. Concannon...?
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Dr. Thompson...?
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Yes.
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Thank you...
Thank you.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
What did she say?
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Listen to me, fella...
What Hotel are you staying at?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
Dr. Gruber.
I want to buy you a drink.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Yes.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Hey, there - open up!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Did you see it come down?
You seem to know a lot about him.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Nothing there now.
They've blocked it!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
We will, sir!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Can I read it?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
These look quite fresh.
Doctor...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
I want my kid out of here now!
no.
Rex saved me.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
Tomorrow night.
And...what's the man doing?
Dylan, where's the man?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You're not crazy, by the way.
The car's no there yet?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Robert?  I...
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
How old are you, son?
Fine.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
Ninety-six.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Can we talk?
Sorry to here it.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
How ya doing?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
What'd you do?
What are they doing?
Yes, sir.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Stow away?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Spying?!
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
What's that?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Tie it off!!
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
It's outta here!
Do you have something to say?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
Yes, that's true.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Need a hand?
This your car?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Why should it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Oh, many things...
That is my permiso.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
But I'm wild at heart.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
What brand'd she smoke?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You're perfect for me, too.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Sailor?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sailor!
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
That don't smell like a More.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
You think he saw us?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
More'n likely.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
How'd you know my daddy?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
Trust me on it.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Sailor? You know what?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
You been drinkin', huh?
Sail?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Get rid of him?
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
You got nice tits.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Where we goin'?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Thank you.
Tripp!
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
I just mean...
He lives with his mother.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
How bad is it for you?
Shut up, James.
So -- what do we do now?
Want some help with that?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
Came to my senses.
How are you -- is it Joe?
No...
You driving this car?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Is that in my chart?
She told you about...
No. There's no one here.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sure.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
...reconcile with Emily.
Goodbye, Grady.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Thank you.
He didn't give his name.
But... ?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
The one that left you?
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
It's warm.
I'm sorry.
You coming?
Want a bite?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
What would you call them then?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
I'm a little worried, James.
Yes, Hannah?
Thanks for that. He all right?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
New?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Well...
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Sara.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
And what did you say?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I lost it all.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Who's this ?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
No.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Yo, Traxler.
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where you stand?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Cherry.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Then what? What?!
Fucking Mariners.
Aren't you glad?
It's not what you think.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
What are you looking at?
It's just a city park.
How does it sound?
You should hear the bird.
Were you watching me?
Don't you have friends?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
Hiya, Walter.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
It's not for sale.
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
I'd keep away from him.
Just trying to be helpful.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Yes.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
But will he... ?
Walter?
That's right.
Why not?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I don't know.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
Please don't do it again.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
They could eat you.
I'm not easily shocked.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
How about in the morning.
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You mean the time you're locked away?
You're scared.
We should live together.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
What's this?
Don't be scared, Walter.
You okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
You got it?!  You got it?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
What are you still wearing that for?
Fine.  Be that way.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
You totaled it, huh?
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
Alright, put this on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
What's the matter with you?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Stand by on the ROV.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
Would we see the flash?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
And how long will you be away?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
There's no comparison.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Find anything?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Nothing... nothing at all!
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Yes, you should go.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Claudia, listen to me...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Then I'll see you later.
What are you saying?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
It's divine!
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
And what are we going to do now?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Why don't you try?
And how come you're up so early?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
I can't say.
I'm a blimp.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
But she watches... she listens.
Why?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Should you see a doctor?
For what?
First thing that comes to your mind?
Have you ever loved anyone?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
He's told you?
Where do you meet?
I fell asleep.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Anything?
One.
Do you know a Marie?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
You have trouble sleeping?
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Why not?  Mmm?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What the child?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
She can't hurt you any more.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you pretty?
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Did you want it to come out?
To be a mother?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Would you like to tell me?
Will she be angry?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
A crucifix.
For me to get sick in.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Agnes, can you hear me?
So I could go to him.
Are you frightened?
Not your fault...
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
You saw it all didn't you?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
I don't know.
Thanks. 
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
???
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You can call me Sister.
Who was the father?
What man had access to her?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
I've already told you what I thought.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
This was before her pregnancy?
You hate us don't you?
When was that?
Your niece!
And my permission?
Bullshit yourself!
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Fine thanks...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
For Agnes.
She's been touched by God, yes.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
For what?  An abortion?
You tied the cord around its neck.
That's enough.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Nine.
Well --
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
I see you go to the night court.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Did you look in here?
What's up?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Oh!
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
What are you?
A book!
What are you doing?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
And we're looking after him, are we?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Yeah ... so what?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Behave...
What's he know?
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Y'what?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
I'll brook no denial!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
My eyes are lighter.
That's what you tell me.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
None for me, then?
What do you think are you're up to?
Paul's grandfather.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
What is he?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Close enough to walk to!
Just machinery.
This is Chaz.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Don't you remember?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
What's wrong?
A transmission?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Hello, Faust!
What do you mean?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Okay.
Dead!
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
What do you mean, no?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
That must have been when he got it.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
This should do it.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Air lock?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
I thought I'd find you here.
They're on the next level up.
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
Where are we?
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Yeah, okay. 
Not a one.  It's dead.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Where did the parasites come from?
Now what?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
No... don't...
Better?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Seal everything now!
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
What's going on?
How much air-time have I got?
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Wait.  Lost it.
Is it still moving?
What happened?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Is this the suit?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Already working on it.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Thanks.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
What is that?
Seltzer?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
What?
Hurry it up.
Jesus.
How's it going?
May I come in?
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Hungry?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Aren't you?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
We never met. That's why.
Feeling better, my dear?
I was there. An eyewitness.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Margo? Lunching in public?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
You've already met.
Right here. A minute ago.
Macbeth.
When? When are you going to do it?
Nothing?
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Bill...
Knit me a muffler.
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
She did...?
Happy little housewife...
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
No heart to burn.
Addison-!
I mix what I like.
Don't be condescending.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wish it were.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
A cowboy.
With the paper to prove it.
Every day.
Ah...
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Don't run away, Bill.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Lemme fix you a drink.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
You need new girdles.
How do you do, my dear.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
It was for my report.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
How long does it take?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
If I only knew how...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
May I have your coat?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Eve... don't cry.
But the raves about your performance-
He can help you.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Right here.
She's just outside the door.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
How far to the station?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
Not to you. Not to Bill.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
With tears?
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
What time is it?
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Who is it? What's it all about?
Would you, really? How sweet-
When you do, let me in on it.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
I'm sure.
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
What's that?
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And?--And?--
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
Nah.  Maybe.
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
Speak.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
FBI too?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
But they both worked at the White House?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
Just tell me his title.
I got Clawsen on hold--
--what do you think?--
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
There were more then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
What else have you got?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--which Young?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Great evening, isn't it?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This is your plan, Finch?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
What?!
Hi...
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
So you're going to Michigan?
You want onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
So we're gonna be close next year?
What?  We both have cars.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
No comment.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
You think she was serious?
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
But, but -- what would I do?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Yes.
Dad.
What was your name again?
Yes.  Seriously.
Okay, I get it.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
I still think you're okay.
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Shame on you!
Uh...
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Tonight?
That's my trick!
Hey...
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Yeah Vick?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
What reputation?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
I think you need your balls reattached.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Either way works for us...
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Andy! Holy shit!
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about your glasses?
This looks familiar...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't know...
We don't both have to die.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Claude...?
What's the problem?
Nothing's happening!
We know you were with her.
Andy...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Shit. I feel sick.
Enough. Cut him loose.
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What did she say?
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Hurry, Grandmama!
Who did you hear it from?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Nervous?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
What?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
You're a princess...
How is our current financial status?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
I did no such thing!
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Who's on television?
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Lyndon Johnson?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Oh!
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
You want your tennis stuff?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
We can digest our-
Yeah?
No.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, I know it's small.
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I'm home!
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Is he in the bathroom?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, let me have this.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Here's a real present.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Christ!
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
What?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Alvy.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Who said that?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
I have some very good memories there.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
What's the matter?
Well, sit down.
You all right?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
M'hm.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh. What about?
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Oh.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Was it a contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
It has your ring.
What's that?
She already has.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Honey?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
Just did.  Jealous?
So?
Stupid tart.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
Cal, my wife Judy.
There's a test, you know.
I call that a perfect day.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.
Whatever you say.
No luck.
Don't get it.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
It's an unfair advantage.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce.
Not properly watered.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
That's under lock and key.
I know.
Panes!  How are you?
Coffee?
We have a gift?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
And I you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Something soft.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Ryan's really angry with me.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I think there are sixteen there.
Well, yes, actually.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Ryan!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
How?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Like the last time.
Everyday.
Shit!
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Why not?
Well, something's wrong.
What did I do?
You're keeping a record, are you?
You don't need to do that.
Like Joe.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Break's over.
Tell me about it.
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Really?
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I order you to find out where we are!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Out here I'm just what?
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
Who is that idiot?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
Ask me why we're so successful.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Wear this.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
This the place?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Not there.  Under the mat.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
What did you do to your hair?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Are you all right?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Would you mind repeating the question?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Well -- I guess so.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Sir?
You left your wife?
You like?  It's all yours.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
What's her name?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
That guy really must've belted him.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Well -- thank you.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How long has it been -- a month?
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Where are you headed?
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Sometimes.
So what happened ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
What are you doing out here?
Who's he?
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Will they attack?
Anybody see some smoke ?
What cat  ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
Touchy.
Yeah.
I thought he was a lame.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
The wind --
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Fucking savages.
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
I think think a lie stinks.
Yes...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Are you finished surfing?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
34   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
215  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Had?
You should know something.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Stay here.
Thanks.
Was there any trouble?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Ben Corbett?
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Be my guest.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Neff, you know better than this...
I'm too old for this shit.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
Uh, Udall?
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So you'll be at work?
No... no thank you notes.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
No, sir...
I can't. I work.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Hey -- you let him...
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
You don't owe me that.
That seems like a good choice.
The two might go together.
Grouchy?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
What the heck do you mean?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
How's Verdell doing?
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Good evening.
Is he dead yet?
What?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Would you leave now, please?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I think you gotta camp it here...
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
But you know where you're lucky?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
You can't --
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
What does that fucking mean?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
I'm on the scent.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Where have you been, Robert?
What?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I know what happened.
A player?
Um, five.
Bullshit.
You're one of them, aren't you?
What does that mean?
Why?
Forget it!
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
They become complicated... messy.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Good.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Then, we wait.
That's right.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What?
What did he want?
You didn't take it.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
That's a ridiculous move.
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
Who was she?
When did it start?
That doesn't sound normal.
Four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
You're very good at this aren't you?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
How would you like the funds?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
How to make a buck!
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Fifteen crowns.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I'm an idiot?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Need any disks?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Nope.
Close!
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Let's split.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Yeah, somewhere?
It's...42 56 76 .
God, I think I need a holiday.
What about me?
Yeah, no problem.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Yeah, pretty well.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
We should be done by the weekend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
Will it help to get you out?
Forget about me Kat.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
And take Jiri with you?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
A champion of lost causes huh?
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
You will wish you hadn't.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Sure!
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
I don't want to go.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are responsible...What has happened?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
So, who is in the building?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
Why not?
You saw him?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Don't call him a dipshit.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
That's deep --
I know you don't want help.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
So what else is on this list?
Like you'd know.
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
Saturn. Beautiful.
You're really into God, right?
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Hey.
Like fire.
Your turn.
You're acting like a crazy person.
Assholes. This happen to you?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
When did you build this?
So what do you want to see?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
One of your secrets.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
It's gone now.
But if you could, you would?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Did you give him a gift?
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
So talk to us about something.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
You've been well?
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Morning Dick.
Learn anything?
It's polyester.
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
What do I say?
Huh?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
What?!
Catch you later! 
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Pretty, isn't it?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
We did it, Ray.
Well, Kit...
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Quit my job.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
You want to go for a ride?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
I came in the front.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
You tired?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
No.
What?
Have you got a better idea?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
What's that?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Who are you?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
Not me. No way.
What?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
What crate?
What is this thing?  A fighter?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
He offered you money?
Another 'you'?
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
What's his problem?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Hello, Barton.
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
How d'ya like your room!
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
...Got a sweetheart?
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
Hold on –
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
What do you think happened?
Jesus... You're leaving.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
...Yes, thank you.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
...Okay
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
So -- how are things?
How about the booze?
No?
How's not smoking?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you didn't hurt --
Because you didn't love him --
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
How exactly did you hear?
Why not?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
How's your new book?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
How's your shoulder?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
Why?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
How did he die?
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Maybe the maid did it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Now what?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Fuck you, Phil.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Why do you think he's dead?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Yes I did.
I'm a painter, too.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Ten bucks apiece.
Ouch..
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Paint it out.
Blue? Where?
Who's that?
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
You're back.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
... babies.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
I really... admire you.
What's your name, man?
Hi.
How can I ever thank you?
Come on.
You're a fast mover.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
We've met.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
And the truth frightened her?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
No.  No glass on the inside.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
I love you, old man.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
This is easy.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I was just hanging around.
Watch the first step.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
And?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It'll never work.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Maybe they're right.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
How are you feeling, young man?
...Afraid.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Like normal folks.
Why do you do that?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
No.  Wait...
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
What is that?
Great.  Give me a grant.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you sail?
What did you see?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
My brother's a priest, man.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Yum, yum.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
There aren't hotels?
It's the last thing we need.
Go ahead.
Liar.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Goodnight Annie.
Everything okay, David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
David, David, David ...
Of course.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
It is urgent, sir.
Interesting suit.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh, you first.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You got two seconds!
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
What?
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
Maybe this is heaven.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
I feel really stupid.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
What is going on?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
All right.  Who are you?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
We're very unhappy.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
How'd you do on the science test?
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Beetle!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Where is your mother?
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Answer your mother.
They're... not here anymore.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Are they suffering?
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Is there much more of this torture?
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Otho, that's terrible.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
He does, does he?
I would like to walk today.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
A Black man gave me the message.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
What is that?
Oh, I like that very much.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you like it?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Bravo!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
How were you paid?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Have you served in the Army?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Yes. I will.
No headaches?
Do you feel well enough for that?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Good night.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I don't know.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Hi.
I want to try.
Now?
I have to go back now.
Why?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
And he was with her.
I need a shower.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Sure, after a fashion.
I know. I'm sorry...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
What?
Why not?
Who told you?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
This is important!
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You're glowing again.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Oh, be still my heart.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
When?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
We have to meet.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
What's the play?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
You still there, sweets?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
I'd love to see your work.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Sleepy suddenly.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Good-bye, Maxine.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
Well?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
What you want'em for?
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Could be that fall you took.
Should I wake her?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Morning.
I know Denver.
I know what I see.
The church!
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
Jesus.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Sethe?
Hiya Allan.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah?
Where'd she been?
Uh-huh.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Where you going, Dude?
What tied the room together, Dude?
I am the Walrus.
Burkhalter.
Kill that poor woman.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Yes, heh--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Excuse me?
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Yeah, but my-
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Donny!  Please!
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Oh shit.  Walter.
Walter!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
"Our" car, Walter?
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Shit yeah!
Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Walter Sobchak.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Dude.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Ah fuck it.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
'Scuse me?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Oh, shit.
I'm not--
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.
Anyone else make it?
Why do you hate us so much?
You're hurting me.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
And so will we.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Any casualties?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
What about you?  You're not coming?
You're not going anywhere.
Hold out your hands.
Why?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
You're hurt --
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
How's it going, Kam?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
This isn't human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
How do you like that? Right on time.
How many of you are there?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
But you use blood banks --
You're a monster.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Who are you people?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
--and if she ever did--
What do you mean?
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Domini?
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--I'm not staying here!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
'Thought those all got stolen.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Looks like business is booming.
Cheery little place.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Just now?
I want to see something!
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
So lemme see it.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What movies?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
We should be so lucky.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
Mi casa y su casa!
Where's Domini?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
What the fuck--??
Yeah. Me too.
--Cotter--
Cotter?
What're you doing?
What?
Let's get inside.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
--it's less than four feet, just--
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Oooh. Oooh.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
She's far from "fine."
"It's why the witch kills children."
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You all right?
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
It'll pass.
Sure don't.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
I told you. I like you.
Well now you do.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Anything else?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Thanks Meurice.
What day is it today, Angie?
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, daddy.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Yes.
You don't?
. I. uh.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
What do you want to do?
You like to open me. don't you?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. no!
I guess I should go.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Oh yeah?
How is Central these days?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Are you alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So. what's next?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Yeah. but.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Okay.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Hi Dad.
Are you feeling okay?
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
No.
No. you're right.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Come on out a minute, okay?
On the plane.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Tuna, this is crap.
Excuse me?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Mirtha.
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
What the fuck is that?
And I only deal with you?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Oh my G-d.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Diego Delgado, please?
Yeah, I'm out.
But you must.  It's the only way.
What's the matter, George?
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Derek Foreal.
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
It's a family heirloom.
Yeah.  Nice.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
I want money.
George, you look terrible.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Hi.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
There's schools in California.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yeah?
So?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Nice weed, huh?
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Of course. As soon as possible.
Go away!
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
No ...
To show them to the UN, right?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
An inquiry into what?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
About three hours.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
What did they argue about?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Can I go?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Yes.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What did she say?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Why does she come to you?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
I heard him say it.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What happened?
I suppose.
I've tried it.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Three fifteen.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
What do you have in your purse?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Hello?
Sorry.
Really?
Yes -- it would be nice.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
What are you going you doing?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
Hello?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
The witness will answer the question.
I can back it up.
If he files are you going to take the case?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
I know.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Lawyer here?
Yeah.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
What are you doing?
Bar across the street.
Nobody did.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
This time of year.
Oh there you are.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
You ought to write these stories down.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I'll pick you up.
Okay. See you later.
It's Robert.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
You want to eat something?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Why do you say that?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
You're somewhere else, where?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
What time is it?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Franny?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
What else?  Money.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I said, no thanks.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
Jimmy, you've got --
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
How do you know?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
What are we doing down here?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Not really to live, just to play.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Admit what?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
The next one blows off your dick.
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar?  What is this?
Sit down, Gino!
I didn't expect --
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
What?
It couldn't have been.
Got to think this through ...
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't see you, did he?
I need you ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Fuck.
Shut up, Violet!
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Is that the money?
You got the key?
See?  We're for real.
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Are they really?
Yeah.
I wanted to apologize.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
We're not that different, Corky.
I don't.
You mean Shelly?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Then what?  Exactly.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
What time did you say they would be there?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
What if he sees you?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
What if he doesn't run?
Johnnie, what did I say?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
No.  We can't risk it.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Treadstone?
What do they want me to do?
Are you Treadstone?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
Keep it. 
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We thought you were gone for good.
I need a ride.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Where did this body go?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
xxxxxx...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
You telephone, sir.
...ixed itself.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
In fact, killing people -
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
What's she done?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Say it was a mistake.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Yes we have, Jack!
It does doesn't it?
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
No, really.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Turn!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I'm going to open it!
They're gone.
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What were we saying?
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Whatever happened to you?
Hello ... hello ...
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I don't know which numero.
I mean it fixed itself.
Sign here please.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Are you expecting anyone?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
No, no, that's impossible.
No underwear?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Frank Pierce.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No. He's dead.
IB Bangin.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Yes?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Not as good as Nino's.
Five years.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Who's that?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Three legs.
Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
The family know?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
No.
Where's Burke?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Don't push it, Larry.
They'll just keep calling.
Well why didn't you say so?
He's crazy.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
What did I do to you?
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
You packing up tonight?
I don't think so.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
Do others feel that you did well?
What?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
We came from Washington.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
It's Aaron.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
What?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Is everything all right?
Anchor?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Why so glum?
Go ahead.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
They said it would be okay if...
Hi.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
It's incredible who's here.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Tonight.
I'm almost ready -
Not even a little bit?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
A girl with a body like mine?
Alright we're clear.
See you later -
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
What's up, Walter?
Where where...
Did you hear what he said?
It's true, isn't it?
I mean, you look so pretty.
I like you very much, Walter.
I'm sorry about what I said before.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
That's word for word.
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Are you trying to be funny?
Are you alright?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
What did he say?
Walter, what are you doing?
Dead Cat!
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
How ya doin'?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Hi.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
It's like...you've turned on.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
T-tell him that?
What's all the noise in here!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
Nice to feel needed.
Nice game.
Don't grab me, okay?
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I... feel.... pretty.
Wheels?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Hi, Buffy.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Hey there.
I am a God!  A God!
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
You want some water or something?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Things are kind of confusing.
You sure?
Buffy?  What's wrong?
He did what he was supposed to.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Time to do what?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I was a slave.
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Oh, him.
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
But you threw a knife at my head!
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
What!?!
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Interesting.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Come one, that was so weird.
I don't get it.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
So very much.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Cool!
Smell of booze much.
What are you talking about?
Except for Prom.
Ah, you'll be coming back.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I'm yours.
Fundamentals?
I think you're real cute.
What'd he say?
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
See my hips?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Don't tell anybody.
Crash...I want you.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got released.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
What's that?
I didn't spit on you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
What do I gotta do?
Settle what?
No.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Little high.
What'you want, kid?
Ain't here.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Hello.
Mommy.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
What?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yes, you lost your control.
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Please...
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Okay. You come by the house?
You go and put your things away.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Half of everything is mine.
...position...
It's always been our policy -
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Sam, we got a problem.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Okay, thank you for asking.
She took care of the dealers...
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Right?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Why do you need that much?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
I bought him a watch too.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
To the Riviera.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Hi, Sam.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Get - Get up! Get up!
Get - get up!
You are not threatening me anymore!
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Okay, I'll -
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
...worst possible time for me.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
You know where she gets this from!
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
All right. Okay, okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Leave me alone!
He's comin' over.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Hi, Jennifer.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He gives a fuck what I do?
What? What?
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Great.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Yes.
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
He was just on the phone.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
They checked in alone.
Yes, don't worry.
Incredible.
Well, how come I laid nine?
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Don't know.
Take it easy!
Charlie M?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You're a little confused?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
I know, but that's enough.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Women, huh?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Spooky.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
For when the time comes..
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Yeah, she's okay.
How much?
Good morning.
Next time, call...
Hey, Captain God!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Nothing. How's your hand?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
What if they do question the authenticity?
Will you two cut it out?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Lady, don't let him do it!
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
You missed.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
And what're you whispering for?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
What makes you say that?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Tell me what she looks like.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
Our house always needs touching up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What's happening?
What bank?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
You can't give up.
Did you hear that click?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
The guy with the transplant.
At least one.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
What's Nels' number?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Any idea where you're going?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
What's your point?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Who are you working for?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Sure.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Satisfied?
And then?
Seems like it.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Yeah?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Can I make a quick call?
He's what she should run a mile from.
You could always make it up to her.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
What you think?
He agreed that he was.
Maybe he wants something.
Take your clothes.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
You American?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
What was that all about?
Perform?
You on the game?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Did he come here too?
What does that mean?
Why?
Why?
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Sorry, darling.
Sure I do.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I didn't mean to hit you.
How?
Will you meet me again?
Am I becoming repetitious?
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Do you like me even a little bit?
You want another haircut, baby?
So it's true, then?
I had to go to work!
What?
You killed my Jody
You didn't.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
You do?
Say it again.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Hey -- what's he like?
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Of course. I forgot.
Perfect.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
What the fuck is this?
So he knows your name?
You sure about that?
He's at home.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And who is she?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
What's that?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Well, I could say the same about you.
I'm not a gambling man.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
You make a nice couple.
I got sent.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Never.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Why?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Oh, yeah.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
What?
Don't think that way.
See if she's all right.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Help me.
Nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
All right -- where's the letter?
Oh, come on!
Oh, you should see your face.
Adam!
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
What is it?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Reggie -- listen to me!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Café.
Yes -- ?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Oh.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Very pretty. Now what?
Why you lied to me.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
You can't.
Whitefoot, of course.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Why can't you be serious?
Said what?
They've got Jean-Louis!
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I think Tex did it.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
What's so illogical about that?
Got you.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
What are you doing?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Please keep it.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Mrs. Lampert --
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Is it all right?
No -- in my room.
Oh, la.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Is your husband with you?
Shakespeare never said that.
Are you in the book?
What are you doing here?
How did you find out?
We'll find you a hotel.
On the street where you live.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Good night.
What?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
What's he up to?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
You're grounded Friday night!
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
You know her?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
What happened?
Is Jody still awake?
What are you doing?
She's not here.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Me? Why me?
Yes.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Mark invited me to the party.
You heard about that?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Are you O.K.?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
My dad's down there!
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes?
On what side of the family?
What are you doing?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
Now don't be nervous.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Stacy?

help me get in the truck. 
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Shit!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.

Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck!

...-damn!

Oh, shit.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
Come on, old...
Fuck! 
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...do we?

 Okay.

Come on, old Pete.
I made it!
Shut up!
...ho!

Hang on!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
All right, let's go.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
He's crazy!

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
I don't want you to come anyway. 

Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
It won't even start half the time.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
 Yeah.
How wonderful for you.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...

Arlo, shut up.
 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 
Go!
Whoo!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 

Oh.

Sorry.

You did help a little.
Us.  Owes us.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...-tiatin'.
Be cool.  Be--
What'd he say?

Vaughn.

...take my sorry old truck.
Listen, deputy.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.

And I changed the schedule.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...-lar.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Now listen to me.
You look fit...healthy...
...-ple.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Mm-hm.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...

I can't say it's a surprise.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.

Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Quite a getup for jacking...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
I want you to look at one another...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.


...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...somehow. 
Ah.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
...tight!

 ...that tunnel.
Thanks. 
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
...-five.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...without caution...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

You're the only one I can trust.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Where are you now...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...on the other end of this phone.
 
Okay, doc.





Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Can I check one of these volumes out?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Why is that funny?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
How do they do that?
I don't want it anymore.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Where?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Mr. Gittes.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
I can't tell you.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Over the water department, or over you?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
...No. Why was it.
I know.
I saw him.
This morning.
What did he say?  What did he say?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
I said I want the truth.
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
Where'd he go yesterday?
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Yeah, Sophie.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
You're a married man, am I right?
Mr. Gittes?
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
The L.A. River?
Yeah?... I do?
No problem with me on the Job.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
They were partners.
This?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
What's that, pal?
Not exactly.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
What are you doing here?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Now what can you see?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
But...who...
You're still beautiful...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
I might make him nervous.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else did you see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Oh!!
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Oh!
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
Yes -
I mean in New York.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Impossible!  Impossible!
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Get Dr. Corey.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
They do it only because you do!
I mean I've got a job for you.
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
What's this?
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
I know, but -
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Who told you you could sit down here?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Well, if it's already too late...
Jesus!
Beats me.
Fifty-five.
That's it, everybody out.
Dick.
So where is he?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Am I missing something here?
He was?
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
It's not what you think.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
No.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You mean, on a date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Then who operated the store?
What about Caitlin?
This is the last time I come to this place.
Who are you to make assessments?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
So?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
She called me.
Eight and a half.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
It takes different strokes to move the world.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Empire.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
More or less.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
You know what Sanford told me? 
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
You hardly knew her!
You hate people.
She meant nothing to you!
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Shut the hell up.
Oh, my god.
No!
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
You know.
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Get to work.
Holy shit. That girl?
You're happy to get a fine?
Who eats cock?
There's no lights back there.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
Are you open?
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What?
Go open the video store.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
All right. Name it.
What do you mean?
Yeah, right.
HOW MANY?
Well...?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Would you let me explain...
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
It stings a little.
You open?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Is he staying here?
I think the lady called it.
Feel that.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
And... he told you all of this?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Twenty bucks?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
A monkey?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
I love you, too.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
What are we going to do?
Four...five...
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Thanks for holding on.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Take the rope.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
What's he doing?
It's up there, on the Tower.
Murdering, motherfucker...
You said there was a way across.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
You're looking at him.
What's the delay?
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't give him anything.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Great, sir. Great.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Yes. They want to help.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
So this is the young man?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Who said that?
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good.
Where is he now, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
I wanna be sick.
Yes, sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
You've heard Beethoven before?
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
How many to a cell?
Go ahead, say it.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
But not now?
You need a vacation.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
...he's two floors below you.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Lay it on me.
What?  What did you say?
Something going on?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
I never bought that.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I'm in town for a short time.
You're gonna cheer up.
He's not paying you one cent!
You hassling my driver again?
Hello?
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
First time in New York?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I think he's dead.
You listening to me?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Try some deep breathing.
You better?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Music.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
So what?
Collateral damage.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Show up for what?
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
The man who hired me for this contract.
How long have you been a hit man?
You get benefits?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
As in...? 
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
You're going too fast.
What happened?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Look, I'm sorry --
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Not for years.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
What's the charge?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
That's it?
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You will?
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
You look great.
Liza?
I don't understand.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
How'd you get the picture?
Blue moon...
I'm a very patient man.
Liza Sutton is dead.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Excuse me?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
<u>Why you</u>?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Agent Lowry.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
That you come with me.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
You know why I'm here.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
David --
What?
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
How can that be?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Can't we get rid of them?
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
So who -- what -- are you?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V.L.A.?
But the work --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Ellie --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
They don't believe me.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
But --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Go hard!
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Go git it, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink? Okay?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
I'm in.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I want to die.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
When he was seventeen.
I was?  How you spell that?
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
In jail.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
We've got another one.
But it's a different m.o.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Ruben.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
What's that siren?
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Open the door.  Please.
You know how to use this?
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I like women like that!
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
Sergeant?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
How'd you get in on the deal?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Did you come?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Are we allowed to park here?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
What does he want from you?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
What do you think of this one?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Really?
You're slowing.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Will you get time off to do that?
Mom, please.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Yeah?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
What have you done with the ring?
We're supposed to be asleep.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Yeah.
Furnished?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
I love your apartment.
I think I should go home.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
No, you've done a perfect job.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
All tapped out.
Agent Hadley.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Oui.
No.
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Okay.   How much?
And?
They're gonna be what?
Someone else coming?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
I don't know.
For what?
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Anybody hungry?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
I will.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Why haven't you turned us in?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Just find them!
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
There has to be.
They don't have a wine list.
Yes.
They don't serve wine here.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about Canada?
How's my brother?
Anybody know about that car outside?
Mr. Zammito?
I think we went the wrong way.
J&amp;B?
Who's gonna see it there?
Why?
You're back!
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
And if I use them to kill you?
You're home late... or should I say early?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Put them down.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
No, really?
You know about Lo?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
What do you want?
Give it back!
Lo?
I don't take orders from anyone.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Don't send me back!
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
She needs direction... and training.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
What happened?
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
And you're gonna tell me who.
No onions though, okay?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Mom --?
At least it finally stopped raining.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Miss her?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
What... the hell is that?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
We've got company.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
You heard me.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Nothing.
You promise not to say anything?
Why not?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
How's the water?
About what?
Need a lift?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
You don't know how to love.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Are you shitting me?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Where did you find those?
Those are my letters!
I'm in the bath, mom.
That's great.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Why didn't you do something?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
Excellent.
What are you doing?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Whoa!
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?!
Yeah?
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I'll think about it...
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
You can put it anywhere.
Call me later.
Moving along quite well.
Any day now.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
That her?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Exactly the opposite.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
No, tell me.
I'm not in the mood.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Why so nervous?
Ronald?
To my triumph, of course.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What are saying, darling?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Where is everybody?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Hello, Amy.
Where did you mail them?
And who did the voice belong to?
No, I didn't.
Daddy!
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Daddy?
You'll always play with me?
But you must!
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Look at my ring.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
No.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Jennifer?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
And then?
At least your PMS is over.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Hello?
I've been here. What day is it?
Get rid of him!
Holy shit, I don't know.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I think I just got my period.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
I think George knows.
You're kidding, really?
You hungry?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
You don't have to pee.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Wow.
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
You busted me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No, why?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Except Mark of course.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
Hello?
You at least owe me the truth.
Peter I love you too but...
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I'm going to take a shower.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
You want her sheets?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
What are you talking about?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Iím your new assistant.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Why give yourself up?
They didn't have faces.
Look!  This is a good one!
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I didn't realise...
Your name is John White.
Known me for long?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm sorry.  About before.
You've been working too hard.
How do you know I'm innocent?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
I'm not certain about...
.. Nothing.
... what?
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Clean.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
What about the wife?
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
When does it break?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
And who's gonna find out?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Fine.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
This is from the people of Burundi...
What are they?
... Sometimes they do.
Really?
You got a gun?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
You're kidding.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
That was quite a thing you did today.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Where's home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
That's a secret.
Yes.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I missed...
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're all set,  sir.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
Curse?
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
How long do we have to watch him?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
He is dying. He knows it.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
What'dya get?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
It will?  How do you figure?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Mr. Keating!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yeah?  Like what?
Don't stop.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Charlie...
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
This is stupid.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Good god, boy! Yell!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
A sweaty-toothed madman
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
But father, it's not fair.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is this, a midnight study group?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
So what do you think of my father?
What?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Todd, what's the matter?
Oh..
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Visit from my father.
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
They are...they are everywhere.
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
And no questions asked.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
Finnegan...
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
I think he knows that Joey.
Joey...it's okay...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What the hell does that mean?
What was that?
Check it out!
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Nick's going?
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
That's new, isn't it?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
No, I --
No. None of that.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
You like to call me Linda now?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Linda, what's the matter?
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Nick?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Merle?
That way it sets.
You do?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Nick, he just came back.
Is he from here?
Promise! You gotta promise!
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I like it, Nick.
No.
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Did you go hunting.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
The fuck I did!!!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Yeah?
Who is it?
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
I want to see my wife and kid.
What's this?
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir---
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Yeah.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
You want to be a good detective?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
How do I look?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You never want to find out.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
You could always take it off.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
Gee -- that Fair --
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Dan'l Webster?
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
He's stubborn as a Stone.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
We must go on home, Jabez.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Do you really think that?
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Hello, Sheriff.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Jabez ...
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
I want someone to talk to ...
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
You're very perceptive.
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Hans, he killed by brother --
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Go on.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
...I've missed you.						*
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
John!
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
This is --
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Aw, hey...
You'll be okay.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Denmark?  Sweden?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
You try calling the police?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Yeah.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Calm down, you're not ...
Sonny, be reasonable!
You're full of shit ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Where's the back door?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
Yeah.
Are you a lawyer?
Thanks again, Sam.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Because I don't want cancer.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You mean that?
He wants one.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

We'd kill ourselves.
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Bullshit!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
We can't stay here.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Why are you doing this?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Okay.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Cunt.
Cunt.
God help us. God help us all.
Really? Did you play in a band?
What did he say about the arm?
We are so fucked.
We're late.
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
I own a brownstone on this block.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
How much?
How long?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I thank you.
Mookie.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Ten.
My name is Eddie.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Sal's gonna be mad.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
No.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Jade, you're late.
This might take some time.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
How many you say?
WAKE UP!
It's dug.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
I would like to get paid now.
Whatdafuck do you want?
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Shit!  I forgot.
How long then?
Tina, you're sweating.
It's cold.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
It's e-vit-able.
I don't know.
I'll do that.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
I know this.
I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
You really think so?
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Pino, relax, will ya.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
But I came here to learn about America.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Mom, you know that never works.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
Who's Principal Collins?
One day they'll find a cure.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Nice jugs.
You're it.
Owww.
That's a cow, Harry.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
I kinda screwed things up.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Captain Rob came back?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Why ith dat newth?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
What are you doing?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
How much homework is there?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
I think you did it.
It's the big potato.
You said "aloha" twice.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
I can assure you...
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
You'll be sitting on the right.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
What is this place?
Why are you here??
What happened?!
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Sorry...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
It's a damn good role.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Isn't he dead?
OUR picture?
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Hello.
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Those assholes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
You're <u>sure</u>???
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
I thought this was a group effort.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
What do you love her or something?
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
Did you see that?
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You think she really likes him?
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ed, can I see you a second.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yeah?
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Ed --
I don't think so.
He's who we want to go with.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
What?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
What's the difference?
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
What?
Ed! How did you know I was here?
What's going on over there?
I can't?
What are you doing?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Cream rinse?
Ha!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I wish my stepfather was here.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So...?
Where?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
It's not their fault.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Kinda'.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
I'm making a tape.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Good-bye, brother!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
No. Two times.
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Hi.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Mm.
Yo --
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
what?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
What?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Mr. M.?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
What a surprise.
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
And when did you do it?
And how did you get in the school?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Are you crazy?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Look.  I want to see you again.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
We talked.
Captain, what do you want?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Give me one minute.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Dudley.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
More or less.
Where are the police academy files?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
You're wrong.
Dudley, we've been over this.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Damnit...
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
She is Lana Turner.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
A vulgar term, but yes.
I'll take your word for it.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
A sweet man.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You're back, boychick.
Around.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
DePinto's dead.
I just gave him my card.
Um...who's that?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
I'm doing a transfer now.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
I'll pay you.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I mean did you call anyone.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
They're here.
Them.
Here?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
What are you dialing?
He came in four minutes ago.
Feeling lucky?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
Your stuff?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Did he give you anything?
For your wife?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I'm sorry.
Have you been working with Rachel?
You <u>swore</u>!
I know, but listen--
Does that hurt?
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
Why the hell would I--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
How's the trout?
Other than Brill.
How can I be sure.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
What makes you think it's you?
He didn't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
She can't talk to you right now.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
In your dreams.
It's okay to use the phone.
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I'm sorry, man.
Turn yourself in.
Are you okay?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
What does that have to do with you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
Yes. But we can't.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It means who's side are you on?
What about the tapes?
The originals?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
No sir.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Yes?
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
How much did you pay?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
This is not very good, is it?
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Do they know them?
Don't.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
A broken car?
What kind of photographs?
Safe journey.
Very well.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
What do you want?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Where did you find that?
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Have a drink.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
This is Captain McGann.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Will you come with me?
I mean home.  India.
It's what I've learned.
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
You've got a mustache.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
What's happening?  Am I needed?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
I'll come with you.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
No.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
So he popped the pane?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Mac's signature.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Are you...okay?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
For God's sake.
The Empress Death Mask.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Fine. What do I do?
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
Nice spot.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I'll need that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
So how long to pop the floor?
I trust it's your size.
Won't take any time.
And--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Ready?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
What?
You've got everything planned.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Pulse detectors.
No way to take another day or two?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Put this on!
What's wrong.
Always in a rush.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
The key to success is using the right tools.
Right.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Tonight your league night?
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
My friend, you always surprise me.
250,000?
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tony Marvin.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Jesus.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Out to lunch with the girls.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Oh, yeah?
So what made you think it was?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Bullshit.
What now?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I'll see what I can do.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Why good?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
I wasn't gonna --
Two million dollars?
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
You come to the right place.
What kind of chromium is it?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Yeah.  A real moron.
What's going on in there?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Can I play roller hockey?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Great.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
That's Ed.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
More than you need me.
No, I need my car --
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're moving away?  When?
Dr. Paulsen?
Oh.  Oh.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
... Luke, you must not go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
... Like we're being watched.
Yeah ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Yes sir!
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Our destruction?  Who?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Sir, I was wondering ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Yes, Your Highness?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
I don't know what he's talking about.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
They're moving away.
What are you afraid of?
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What'd you say?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
You rest now.
Closer?!
What??
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
Jabba the Hutt?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
That they are.
Price?  What do you mean?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
Yes, My Lord.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
What are they doing here?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Ooww!
Oh Cuervo...
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
That's the deal.
Defense against what?
She's in the green.
Where are they going?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Later.
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
All of us?
Thanks to God, you are alive.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Arthur.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
Guenevere...
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
But, I'm here.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
And you cannot love me...
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
The law forbids it.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
You are truly magnificent!
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
The oath. You didn't say--
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's-
I'm sorry.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Here.
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
What did the doctor say?
I'm gonna miss you.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Thank you.
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
There is nothing.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Excuse me Miss?
Morning.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Chris MacNeil?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Where's Regan's father?
Yes. He's already here.
Oh look at that.
Hey, where'd this come from?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Yeah
Mr. Dennings?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Where'd you get it then?
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Think you can sleep?
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Did you do that?
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
Amen.
Shut up!!
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Miss?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
No.
Give me the keys.
What about tomorrow?
Maybe next time.
Honey ...
Beasley.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
This time you gotta go.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
A gust of wind killed him.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
What's that?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's the matter?
See anything?
I thought we had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
All night?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
Funny, huh?
You saw wrong.
The party's over.
April.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
What're you doing?
Cancel, Frank.
We're not getting paid then.
You don't know?
What channels it on?
Jack, you're on television.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Yeah, fine.
So what'd you think?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
How should I take it?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What's the problem?
What-?
It's orange!
A seven.
They're tight.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Right.
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
Got another song for us?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Uh ...
I can't sing it anymore.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
No.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
And you don't?
You miss him, don't you?
Fucking.
He do that every year?
How do you do it? Every night?
I can keep the beat.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
History.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
What kind?
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
How do you know?
Oh?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
From Hurley's?
Big piece or little?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Pollux ...
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
That's not the worst part.
For being one helluva guy.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
No.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
-- Castor?
What -- what are you doing?
You'll what?
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
You merciless bastard!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
I'm just having some fun.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What's that?
You'd have to start immediately.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Hello?
Why Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
She said that?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
But what do I do?
Like the dress...?
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Here you go...
Excuse me?
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
How was the game, honey?
Not it...?
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Jack...can we afford all this?
I need to tell you something.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I could stay here forever...
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You look great.
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
No...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I had it at four.
The shields on the station should protect us.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
What?
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
I though we went over this.
Stop it.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Then what is it?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
What are you doing?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
It's just business.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Benes... What the devil happened?
How bad off is he?
-- and why we need you.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
What is it?  Anything wrong?
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Doctor, what's wrong?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
I've done all I could with the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
You said there was a quick way out!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Sounds like heavy artillery...
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
You have no right to blame Duval --
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Come on -- it's no use!
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
What's wrong, Skipper?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
...Would it kill you to say something?
Unguent.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Blood has been shed.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah, he -
Oh, don't be silly.
How ya doin'?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
You're not a C student.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Yah.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Mr. Lundegaard?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, but -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah!
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Norstars.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Hiya, Lou.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
Yah.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
...Hello?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
Oh. Geez.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Was it reasonable?
...So?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Uh-huh.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
What... ?
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
Cornelius!  How are you?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Is that your blood?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
It becomes an addiction.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
In case we want to switch nights.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
No, thanks.
Uh ... nah.
Guy or girl?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
What?
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
Let go of me!
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Yeah.
Huh?
Can I stay at your place?
The fight.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
I know that.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Promise?
You want to finish her off?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
We don't need him...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I asked you what you studied.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
"Too young?"
Four in Milwaukee.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Is this really news to you?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You took me to the house.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Who is this?
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Yeah, how?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
No!  It can't be.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
Shouldn't we pull over?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Remember the departure time?
Carter, get out!
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
And don't pass on the right.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
You okay?
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
I've seen worse places.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
You never been in one of those things.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Why'd they want us?
John.  My name is John.
That's an order.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Black.  No sugar.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Who're you?
What's your name?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
What?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Most men are.
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Now what?
They said you're The One.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Do you follow her every day?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
But I gave it to you!
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
SAW WHO!!?
.....What are you doing?
Are there any questions?
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Are you all right?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well, it's enough for me.
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Cerveza.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
You just going to sit there?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
No. We have tomatoes.
You always do this to me.
Sorry.
Oh.
I have to talk seriously with you...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Well...  I better let you...
What questions?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
But what about me?
What have you been doing since then?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
If you're free.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Is that funny?
Wait...
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
And what about love?
You better hold onto your tongue!
Mass production is what does it.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
You know somebody around here?
That's it?
How you treat them?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Come down!
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
What are you going that way for?
Where you goin'?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think by Twenty-two.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You looking for somebody?
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Fletch!
Right.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
So what do you figure?
Like when?
Thought so. What for?
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Are you serious?
Good evening.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I'm the Sufi.
Why are they after you?
Sure you did.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
So why pick me?
A .357.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
That's right.
Yo!
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
So?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
I was afraid you'd say that.
They just left, sir.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Your call is come through.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
So you're saying she moved out.
Tell the cops.
Fletch.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Now that we've broken the ice...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Ah, an obvious choice.
What an interface!
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Hello?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Spunk, come back...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Are you okay?
My axe!
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Ick.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Gut feeling.
Ouch.
Who cares?  I got a case.
I'm sorry...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
So, did you find my dad?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
What's fine?
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
What about Don?
You'd said something about proof...
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
You're that guy, the private eye.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's cute.  You're funny.
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
You don't use shit?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
What?
Man, I'm clean.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Sale boulot.
It's beautiful.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
When ya go back on?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
What about Sal?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
It was a crematorium.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What do you mean?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Deleon.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Where are you transmitting from?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
It's really you, isn't it?
What's that?
On the job?
But that's tomorrow.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
What?  What is it?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I'll be damned.
How?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
You all right?
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
What?
He took your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
John, you there?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She makes ten.
Which means he probably knew her.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
What?
Got a minute?
I look familiar?
No kiddin'?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Who brought up this bright idea?
What're you gonna do?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Think you can figure it out?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Which one is it?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Why did you come back here?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
In that little thing?
See anything?
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
I never said you were "nothing".
I thought that was the end of the song.
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
....with a woman's touch.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
What?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
Why?
So what happened?
Where'd you get this?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
No, I --
You need to leave.
Legs giving you trouble?
I gotta get back to work.
Hello...
Get up!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Tell me.
Tell me!
She's beautiful.
Why didn't you tell me?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Steven!
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
No thanks.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
What murders?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
What a beautiful day.
I...I can't...
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Big mess every time.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.
Is it safe?
You say we go?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Where are you going?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
Had to be him.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
It's your best play, Nicky.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
Why won't you tell me your name?
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Life is good.
People are dependable.
Where the hell are you?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Let's not start that again.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You're charming the boy.
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
'm not worried about this kid.
Have to hurry back.
Yes.
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
You know what.
Is it true?
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
No one's waiting.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Oww!
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You're a clergyman.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
You mean Gandhi?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
I would rather march.
You mean a general strike?
Who is that young man?
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You're an extraordinary man.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
We don't have the manpower.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
How often do you test, Director?
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
At least it's nothing contagious.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
You really need that much?
That's not the point.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
What makes them think that?
Where?
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
You really had other offers?
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Where are we going?
Everybody goes there.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What do you think?
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
No bother.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
You didn't know?
Of course I think about it every day.
A year is a long time.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
The doctor will give you something.
What about them?
Hello, McCoy.
What about your wife?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
It doesn't look like that.
Half a million.
How's Estelle?
Boring.
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's just been a while.
Why are you laughing?
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
They checked in.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
There better be a guy with the
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got it all figured.
Are you hungry?
Sounds good.
So what?
You're crazy.
I don't know, airport I guess.
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
That's right.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Hope you get to where you're going.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How was that?
Which way?
Come on. How much?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
What's the damage?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
You knew what I'd do.
What about the brakes?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Everyhing go off all right?
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Though nicer than most?
I call that regular.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
And you didn't know her last name?
Thanks for coming.
You all right now?
You coming to South America?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
I won't be using the room tonight.
It's not like that, luv.
Will this do?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
You sod.
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Are you tired?
Is he?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What's it to you anyway?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that?
You're not seeing me?
Deadbeats all.
It is.
It's not.
No.  That's absolutely right.
Yes.
Who?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Starting up.
Just the act.
You don't ax your sales force.
You build it!
...you're absolutely right.
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
As an idea.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
You...
Me?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...you don't have to come in...
Me?
That's ridiculous.
Do you need five grand?
Can we get some coffee...?
Yes.  They are old.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
The cops?
They aren't?
You have nothing to hide.
Will you excuse us please?
Did they catch...?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Why?
Then put me on the board.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
No.
Is that what you're saying?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
You are?
What are you trying to tell me?
How do you know I made it up?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Dave...
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
When?
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
The monthly interview...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Yeah.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
What would have elapsed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
She wants her money back.
I can't regotiate.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You just this morning...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
What is this, your farewell speech?
They took some of the con...
...you want to go out today...?
...Mr. Williamson...
Are you alright?
Do you like them?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You would risk your life for strangers?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Beautiful.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
He's not the same as when I met him.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Me too, Tom?
If you need anything, just...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
What was it, so I'll know.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Go on, tell me.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
...and the tape will be running.
Is he related to the witness?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Why too late?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
There are still things I have to do.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
No, I meant lose his family.
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
However I can help you...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
I know.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Trust me; do as I ask.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You want a war?
He supports me.
So what did you think?
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
What's that mean?
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Then you're as single as I am.
You're sure of that?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
And your name is --?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Does that surprise you?
What way might that be?
Sorry.  Not today.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Who's that?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Is that --?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
So it is going to happen after all.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Did I hurt you?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
What are you doing here?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
How's the leg?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
They gave you only four days?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
I know you --
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
How's that?
You'll leave -- ?
And this has what to do with me?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Not my girl anymore
Diane 1.
Donny --
What about him?
What color?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
How are we supposed to--
What does that mean -- ?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
oh.
I know...
You goin' home?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
You okay -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
You can handle it?
Shadow games ...
Dad'd be proud --
What era was that -- ?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
You want me to buy her?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
He give you an advance -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
On account of Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
And here I am...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
I go with you --
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Ready -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do ... I cut "em...
Now... I'm in ...
Where to -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Some crew you got ...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
How old are you now, Toby?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
What did you hear about that thing?
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
I don't care. Something's going on.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What'll I tell Fran?
You want the melon?
I better call again.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
What happened to you?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Stay there.
I hate to do dishes.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
You and Morgan throw?
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Okay.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
--That isn't funny--
How much money you got?
Come on, Will...
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Some other guy?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
I'm not sure--
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
And what do you see?
Where is it touching you?
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
No.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
So who won the bet?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
He married his cousin.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What do you want to do?
I might understand that.
You're getting defensive, Will.
That must have taken you a long time.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
Why thank you.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Oh, I know.
I know.
See ya.
You suck.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Yeah?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
You grew up around here?
Come with me to California.
I know. I just do.
Why not?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Want to work?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Deputy sheriffs.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Is it fur?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
They're all gone--or dead.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
What's the matter? What's happened?
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Goin' far?
Been doin' a job?
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Yes, ma'am.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Where you think you're going?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Pa! Shh!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Ma, you sick?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I ain't full.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
They gone.
Here we go!
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Now you done it! You busted it!
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
How long has it been?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Are you going to the reunion?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Are you there?
Flowers. That's funny.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
What if I come back?
You kill people. 
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Say more.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
They're not happy, sir.
In Detroit. This weekend.
No, I don't have one.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
No. You drove us here.
I'm a professional killer.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Shit.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How did you meet her?
Just make yourself comfortable.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Show me again.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I'll come.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
David?
Yes. We're suing.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
It's me.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
Aw... that's so sweet.
Why did you go?
You've already made arrangements!?
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Yeah, what?
Where to?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
What choice!!?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
- See, what you can do for him --...
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Don't you go to school?
Of course I have.
Yeah?
She gonna be long?
I can't...
Sure?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
You want to watch some television?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Did you notice -- no cane?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
You're looking fit.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Secret Service!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
What's that?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Hold on a second!
Ta-da!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Yeah?
Dade?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
That's Razor and Blade.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
What the hell is going on?
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
I'm Crash Override.
It's too much machine for you.
Your slave?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Ready?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
You look good in a dress.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Excuse me.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Mr. Belford?
Yo, what's up?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Phreak?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Thank you.
Hello, operator services.
Just one moment.
Purpose of visit?
I'll take you down there.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
What's going on?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
When did this happen?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Mom, please
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Honey, I don't think their home.
Why wasn't I notified?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Has he been prepped?
I do.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Night Doc.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
What?
We'll hear sirens soon.
You won't look pushy.
Do you?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
How's it powered?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I don't see anything.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Yes, you can.
Wait a minute here...
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Get him out of here!
You idiot!
I wonder where they went.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
Anybody live here?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
They could be.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Hey, Laurie...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Yes, I am.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the rest of my comic books?
The bogyman!
How?
I've given them his profile.
PROBABLY going.
If you say so.
Pull up to the entrance!
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
We're a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?
Uh...
What?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Mm-hm.
Now I ca-can't remember.
And it's just in one ear?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Oh!
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
This is not an easy situation.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Mm-hm?
Great idea.
Are you in a bad mood?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
You matter to me.  Completely.
I am... I did slave all day.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh, Jesus!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Yes, please.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Come on.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Oh!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
Oh, God...
You treat me like a loser.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You're too demanding.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Thanks for a swell time.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
People change...you know.
Well...
No, I haven't.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Thanks.
Mickey?
Hi.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Well.  Word gets around.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
...you...
I'm looking for...
...why?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
Then you tell me, then.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
I like Popcorn...
...they're from Baltimore....
He is...?
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why?
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
No. 
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...yes.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
If your duty requires it.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
...long overdue.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
...when I... 
What's that, Baby?
Look what they put her on...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Don't shoot yourself.
Give me your gun...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
...<u>sadly</u>...
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Freeze!  You're busted!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Fuck off.
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
All right.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I was talking with someone!
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Guess who?
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Did to.
Your son's dead and you love him.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
You know what I want, babe?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I think I'm dying . . .
Him.
This.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Are you a dream too?
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Since what?
Must be nice.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
What's wrong, Trev?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
That was cold...
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Morgue...?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Hey buddy!
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
What's under that sheet...?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
-Tawny.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I...
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
The homeless!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Underbelly!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
It's not right, Gale...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Helluva story!
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Reporters don't have hormones?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
You test each one thoroughly?
Safety?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
How's the new place?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Everything breaks at once.
Do you have a family?
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
What happened?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man?  Was it a dream?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Whew.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
We're going to think about it.
Did you hear that?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I thought we'd be happy here.
The cab's waiting!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Are we gonna buy this house?
Neil, do you mind?
What did the thermometer say?
Is it a king or a queen?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
France.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
Agreed.
Different places.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Yes.  How did you know?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Where did you get it?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
Why not?
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
On the back it has--
Where will you go now?
Must you fight him?
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Talley.
What'd you find out?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Talley?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Let me come get him.
What about my father?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
The cops are comin'!
What the fuck is that?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
What if it goes south?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
What do you want?
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I need to work out some stuff.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
You leave that gun alone!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Now we can do whatever we want.
You gotta pee?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What do you want?
I can't go without Thomas.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What's going on?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
That's enough.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
Let it go, Captain.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
How about you and your sister?
Is my daddy okay?
He has lots of disks.
Did you find the disks?
Who are you?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Anything. Strong.
Excuse me, Colonel.
They fired a rocket at us.
Will you protect us.
What is it?
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
You know what the Scottish call it?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Here, have a sandwich.
Great, I really need a shower.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Excuse me.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Was there blood?
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Let's have dinner first.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
What is it, Paul.
Paul, don't let them die.
What!
This won't do.
Any luck?
What's the matter?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
It was substantial.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
I have to stay.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Can I have your name again?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
How much beer?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Out? Where are you going?
All. What do you mean all?
Why the hurry, Roger?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- bullshit --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, for chrissake --
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
What are you playing here, Price?
Where is it??
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
-- I did: down here.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
What is it? What's in there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- the stained glass --
Thanks.
What? Deep down inside?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Price!!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Then who are they?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Steven --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
I think...I may have the answer.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
What is it??
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Won't do any good.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
Pritchett: what is going on?
-- Eddie!!
Town records are coming up now.
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
Good-bye.
Can I do it again tonight?
Well then who did?!
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
I wish I knew more about her.
God rest her soul.
Are you playing tricks on me?
But do you agree with me?
Who?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
How are we doing?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Are you all right?
You must be a Londrigan.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Where did you find this?
There's something in there.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Hello?
Something bad.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
What?
Why are you so interested?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
What ... What ... ?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
You're apologizing?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That was beautiful.
The security's actually not that severe.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You got about five minutes and change.
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
We're going in from the ground floor.
Count of three?
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
I'm going to find out.
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
I was the Warden?
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Bunny, not you too?
Don't I know you...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Something short.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
-- and she's dynamite!
You're from Muncie?!
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Sid found me the icepack.
...Huh?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Oh, Norville --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Muncie.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
You can't print that!
Just got hired today!
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
How long've you been down here?
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Geez, I --
...This'll only take a moment.
Well, frankly, I...
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You're fired.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Finally.
Ya don't say.
Hello, Niagara.
...adenoids.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
But, Mrs. Rand --
Mrs. Rand...
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
Where were you trained?
The West Indies?
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
-- But, you're an American?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
Why was the maid crying?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
I've never given it much thought.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
Don't be dim.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me --
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Hi dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Classes?
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Talking to me, dad?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
But...
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Good shit.
You want coffee or something?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I used to know how to cook.
Here you are.
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Reverend Edwards.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
What do you mean?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
How do you know this shit?
No one.
It's freezing.
Did you tell Sandy?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
When worlds collide.
You're parents at that party?
You get in trouble?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Her name's Libbets.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
All my model planes.
Yeah.
He's dead.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
So far.
My partner...
How much closer would you say you were?
Duggar called him?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What are you doing here?
Forget your pager?
They're all over everybody.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Will.
Stuff.
I told you I don't remember.
How should I know?...
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She was only seventeen.
I suppose.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
You're not following procedure.
Monstrous.
So you have the answers...
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I have not spoken to him...
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You didn't even warm them, did you?
More.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
What was that?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
He can protect us, Claudia.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
The girl, Lestat -
Why do you do this Lestat?
Unless I make her one of us...
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Lestat!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
It's only a siren...
And they frighten you?
I have to go now Lestat...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You loved Yvette...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Yes.
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Get lost, you scared me.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No means yes.
The number's unlisted...
But, he said he'd try.
He does work hard.
Oh!
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Let him go. I believe him.
Be careful, Julie.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Oh, god, it's you --
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Don't kill me --
The shower again?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Deep breaths --
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
Where is everybody?
Take this.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
) You feel the symptoms?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
You are fortunate in your father.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
You know that sound, Oliver?
Do you mind if I go with you?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Get that ladder up here.
Good morning, sir.
Oh, no.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
By letting me help you.
What'd you say?
You have no car.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
She's . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
A boy?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Hi, Daddy.
It will?
Daddy!
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
What's that?
Hmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well then, how do you know?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Oh, it's wonderful.
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
George.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
Violet Bick!
All of it?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Well, hello.
Eighteen.
What'd you wish, George?
I'll take it. And then what?
Ouch!
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How fast does this go?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Why'd they decide to move?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
I don't know.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Good morning!
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
We got a helluva tide this month.
I know just where to go.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Mike?  Is that you?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
May I have this dance?
It came up during the meeting.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
The what?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
And sound.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Hey!  That's my boss!
Eat Cheerios.
All summer?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Yeah?  Then what?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
They made me go with them.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
How old is your cousin?
You're not going out right away, are you?
No class.
Maybe it's gone.
What about sailing?
What about the others?
Right after, the Kids went out?
Hurry, please.
What is it?
What's the lighthouse?
You do everything your parents tell you?
What's wrong?
They're turning around.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Take me.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
You called, Doctor?
It's his work.
Not enough loving.
They're coming with us?
What do I do now?
Honey... you all right?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
And leave me down here???
After what happened to us?
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
You want me to stay?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
No, we'll go through here.
It's too soon to move him.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
I am.  You're not.
Are you okay?
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I will.
Like hell!
Let's hope he knows that.
Not at all.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
How come?
You were great out there!
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
Yes, it's great!
Isn't this fun!
What're you doing later?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
She still talking to you?
You'll spoil her.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Where are you going?
Like mother, like son....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Where have you been...?
You knew...?
That hurt....
Are you all right?
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
You're damn right I'm serious....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
You could teach...You could....
You look tired....
It got him....
No....
Flies the plane....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I don't know how....
What's wrong?
You promised me a drink....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
They had them on the big one....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Grab your socks....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Come on, Hoagie....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Stop farting around....
You tagging them...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
When I got the grant.....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I don't know shit about electronics....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Bring her to starboard.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Woman has taste....
Cow tipping?
I'll take care of it.
Did you like that, Mama?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
There's nothing in the files?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
We're going.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Stop it.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
Sure.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Is this normal?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
You must have some idea about him.
No.
Me?
Did Amber have a dog?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
You know? How do you know?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Why can't I stay with you?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
Interview over, Blattis ...
Yeah, I guess I do.
You think John would like it?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No no...
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, thanks.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Me too.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Well -- this would be goodnight.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Oh God.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
First you gotta tell me something.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
At last I find you.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
What's wrong.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm asking you a question --
That's an answer.
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Oh, tell the story.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Hi.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
I don't see any.
What's going on, Jerry?
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
Her new boyfriend.
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say!
That's him. That’s Eric!
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I don't remember
He could have died.
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
I don’t know.
Eric!
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
I CAN GET HIM!
Hmm?
He used to know me.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
Bonitas.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
We're safe!
Hmmm.
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
How do you mean?
Sorry.  We were saying?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I don't believe you.
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Cancel that, Dieter.
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You version of it.
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Lava?
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
-- way we could safely --
That little black line?
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
But would we get the phones back?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
You shouldn't use my name.

They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Alan?!
C'mon on, this way.
It's all right.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?

You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Don't do that!
I hate trees!
Chain saws.
Jesus Christ!
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
What?
What's going on?
It's still on.
What happened?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Sorry.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Oh?
Cute waitresses?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You're not going to be there?
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Ten minutes...
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
A true friend would do it.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Ludwig.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Father!
I want to thank you.
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Man Eater!!!
Did you see her?
What was it, Jack?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Did you fear for your life?
Why?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
Why? She's a junkie.
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I do not love him.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well I have to close up now.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Why isn't he locked up?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
What about?
Why?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Well do you think it was him?
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
You said it was!
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
How can you do it to yourself?
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
You and I -- a relationship.
Bree --
Go down in my room.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Where'd you spend last night?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
Some mistake perhaps that --
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
You were hired to look for Tom.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Does that distress you?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
What about my orange juice?
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Sleep tight.
Objection.
Wow!
Is that really your chair?
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to get remarried?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
And how did you find his work?
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
A heavy drinker?
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I'm not taking him with me.
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
What if I fight it?
John?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
How many?
You're sure?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
California?
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Ted.
Where will you keep them?
Goodbye, Kundun.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Yes.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Do I have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Has anyone died?
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Me?
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
It seems like we're getting lower.
Why are we landing?
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I can arrest you!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
He never said "go".
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Where is he?
And how would we neutralize him?
He's gonna live?
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well.  Goodnight.
What?
Thing we can lift it?
I'm not mushing it.
Calm down.
He's mooing.
No.
Are they feeding?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Thanks for your help.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
I wouldn't.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Not yet.
What?
They don't believe her.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Are you okay?
Should I?
Hey.
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
<u>You</u>?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Myra.
No. He won't come after me.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
"- every day."
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I am, yes.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Go, Doctor.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
I - ran away...
On what basis would they reject him?
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Thank you, Clarice.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Are you alright?
What?!
The Ottawa are gone.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Yes. Go ahead.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
How long?
Head for... for the white water.
And if we're unlucky?
What did you say?
Will you men help us stop the French?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
What a place for them...
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
What is enough?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
The honors of war?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
And?
DeJesus!  A readout!
It's got Hazy!
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
That's an order!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
They know, don't they?
We're on backup air.
Oh, God, she's out there...
Twenty minutes...
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
If he had his blinkers on--
What happened?
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Typhoon?!
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Clear for pickup.
How is he?
What is it?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
A what?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
What's that?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
There are no others.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
I hate these Southern shites.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Where?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
I hope this is the right move.
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
Go on.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
What are you doing, Plank?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
That isn't true.
Out of the Army?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
And you and Private Graves--
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
So?
I'm not picking it up.
Whole different story; isn't it?
You still going to all the home games?
Suppose not.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad--?
I have a B average.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
What?
Cliff--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
Seriously.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
Never heard from him again?
No.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
He still living?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
No. Is he sick?
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
You gonna stay out here?
Time marches on.
Three months.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
People liked him.
Nice-looking kid.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Yeah?
Like your story is over.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
We start from scratch--
They got telephones.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Yeah?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Take a look at this.
Hokey enough for you?
D'Amour.
Who did this?
Who did this?
Please.
Anything?
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Will you come to him on your knees?
And are you afraid?
What's the connection?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
He's good.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Harry?
Oh God!
Don't look.
What about me?
What makes you so sure?
And this Butterfield guy--
Trickery and divinity.
With what?
Go away.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
I saw him in Vegas once.
What's the difference?
Are you sure?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Don't bother.
You need an ambulance.
Hold on.
Harry D'Amour.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
You know Vinovich?
I only wear ties for funerals.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
That's where we're all going.
Call me tomorrow.
Maybe... I... don't...
You could still help me do that.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Ok.
What are you doing here?
How long have you been married?
Hi again, how's it going?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Oh.
That's too scary.
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
So, where'd you go today.
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Uh, no.
Not all that pasta.
I guess she's busy.
When are you coming home?
Evelyn Waugh?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Yeah.
Oh, the record company sent these...
I miss you.
Lauren?
You never said anything to me...
Uh...sure...I...what?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I'm still shaking.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Seemed...on edge.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father, please don't die.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Yes... and you are?
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I'll bet.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
So what'd I miss?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
You should think about getting professional help.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What can I do?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
He was trying to tell me something.
Hello?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Good of you to stop by.
Would you sign it for me?
Thanks for handling this.
Monica, what did you do?
nothing.
There you go.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
So you're still breast-feeding?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
You could make a career by telling me where.
It means a lot that you came by.
So how long is this trip?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
I told him you looked like me.
They ever love you back?
I know.  But chances are...
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Thanks, Sidra.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
For real?
I don't know.  A lot.
A ride home.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Hey.
You finish the reading for E-con?
Forget Tonya Randall.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
You're what?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Funny.  I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Actually, I don't...
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
It just isn't.
From basketball.
I heard enough.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
We should head over.
Not great.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Where's your dad?
Guess he talked to you.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Sorry.
What's Mom think?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
From your mouth.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
You ok?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Hello?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
My mother had breast cancer.
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
Don't sit down.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
uh...uh...What is it?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
ok.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Well.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Where's Richard and Julia?
What happend, what's going on?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Did you listen to me?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
That's right.
Picky, picky.
You see?
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
What is that?
And how much is braces?
Give me your keys, Don.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
I need to sit down.
Get a girlfriend.
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
All it takes is one second?
I'm gonna start rolling --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
It's all important --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Yeah.
the valley?
And "Frank?"
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
He's in here.
How long have you taken care of him?
How long...you think?
It's interesting.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You're just come in --
What does it look like?
You're here.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
What happend to you?
Are you ok?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
You want her right now?
How you doing?
Come home soon after the show.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
Was there anyone that I know?
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Yes you do.
Hello?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Are you on drugs right now?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Where will the money go?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Phone number.
Partridge?
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
Yeah.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Go to it, handsome.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
What is that?
No, M'lady.
My Queen...
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
He who is not with us is against us.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
But --
Bloody hell...
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
We go someplace dangerous.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Recent hours have been a shock.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Continue.
... The ball... Continue.
What number did you tear out?
Did they kill him?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Sire!  I -- How did you --
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
It's Marvosa -
Yeah?
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Find out for me.
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Speak of the devil.
So where are you from?
Where up north?
Mind if I turn out the light?
What's going on here?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Don't you guys ever knock?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
What have we missed?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Who did he ask for?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Run it.
Get me a plane!
You got the message Lecktor called...
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He's a very shy boy...
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
It does, doesn't it?
Will...?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
You worked out well.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
No. Reba...?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
What am I doing here?
'No' what?
You will tell the truth?
Yes?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
Okay.
I don't understand.
He's very strong physically.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
That's right.
Yes. Who are you?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Why should I tell you?
Pray tell.
Do you dream much, Will?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy?
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Right...
Hi...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I'm gonna quit.
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Excuse me, Andy...
"Philosophically"?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
They are dead.  In either case --
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Don't be ridiculous.
Dead.  All dead.
What is he doing?
Hello?
Morpheus...
How?!
No!  It's too far away.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This isn't real?
And she knows what?  Everything?
And she's never wrong.
She helped you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
We need an exit.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
How...?!
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Hello, Neo.
From what?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Uh-oh...
Is it?
Should I be?
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
Can you fly that thing.
Where is it?
What are they doing to him?
How?
How much time?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Operator.
Tank, you're hurt.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
No, all we got is $40.
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Where to?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Panther...
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What do you mean?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Keep your mouth shut.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Hey, where you been?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
It's still sick.
Bore.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Scumbag--
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Just keep him quiet.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Daddy!
From the Korean War.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.
What do you do that for?
-- Did I hear 'business'?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
We have an arrangement now.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Perhaps you could remind me.
No, I don't --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
In my sleep.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
Why?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
And what do I get?
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah, that's what he said.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
He was interested.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
He said that?
What you then?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
No, I come to see Doctor.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Thanks.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
'Big'?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
Come again?
Goodnight, Joe.
Very well, I'll watch.
Why?
No.
You're here?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
I like you in a black tie.
The 'coffee shop' --
I'm still here.
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
You think so?
No --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
And what?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
How about giving a guy a break?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
Yes.
Excellent.  What is it?
Uh-huh.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
You were just curious?
Hello, Bill.
Yes, I saw you see me.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Okay.
He is --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Yes.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' what?
Where are you?  Are you there?
I'm sorry --
What question?
The 'question' --
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Eddie?
I hope so.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Don't get carried away.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Thank God.
Are you okay?
You know each other?
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
You don't know anything about Joe --
I love him.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Nothing lasts.
Not at all.
I've got to go --
...We know so little about each other.
21.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
Slam it?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
So you're holding my calls?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
Jimmy?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
What?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
It's not easy to be calm when -
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
Neither do I.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
They're not looking for him.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
On the house.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So what are you gonna do now?
Prove it.
She has no idea who I am.
Envelopes?							    *
What's wrong?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
What was it for?							   *
* Thank you.							    *
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
We're not certain...
When?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Where's that?
How's he not your husband?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Hola, chica.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Red light, green light, José?
Stevens?
Where we meeting 'em...?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Like...?
Where?
Hey, fuck him.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Detective Crockett.
From whom...?
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You sure?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
What flowers?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
And as an investment in the future...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do you care?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
What the hell did you do?
What...?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
I can tell, can't you?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
I'm scared.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
These guys're good drivers.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
What d'you want?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You really want to do business?
Get lost.
'Figgers.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
To what?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
You know where they are?
How far?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Yes...?
Yes.  I think so.
Just what?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Got a family back there?
What's your father do?
How's it feel?
What they give you?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
Why the suit?
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
You're ayip!
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
Jeremy...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Oh, that's gonna work.
What?
Wait a minute-
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
He's special.
What are you doing down here?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Oh, no, you were-
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
You sure you didn't see one of these?
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
You're very kind...
What's your new book called?
The profanity bothers you?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Thank you so much.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Done?
Then light the match, Paul.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
You've been out of your room.
Yes, Paul.
Did I do good?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
They're hauling Misery into court.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yes.
People sure like those Misery books.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Hey, Pete.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
I thought you were over it.
I thought you were going to dinner.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Feel like pleading for your life?
There it is, guys, the last of it.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Well do you disagree with that?
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
We're due to take off.
Range is two kay.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- this is very disconerting..
I wouldn't do that.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
You don't trust me.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
- you who don't have a conscience.
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
Luther, say again.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
That's S.O.P..
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
What?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Go ahead.
No sir.
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Why, may I ask?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
IMF mainframe.
Merci.
Claire.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Tell you what?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Iíve got a shadow.
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Jim...?
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
I knew about Jim.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Thirty-two and change.
Yes...  Itís him.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Uh-huh
Who's dead?
I don't like him.
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Hi.  Hi.
I don't know what you mean.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What are you doing here?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Why didn't he call himself?
I like it well done.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Fast.
Why?
Stupid yourself.
Yes.
I'm a wolf?
To the bed.
I was dead.
I've got you.
It's so bright.
Oh my God.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
What did I do?
Why not?
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
What's the matter?
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Have Something.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Yeah.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
So we'll sell the house.
Did he tell her?
Hi.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
We just come from the bank.
I know.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
Who was that?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Yes?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Yes.
Then why are you eating alone?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Temperature's dropping.
I guess you can't invite me in?
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
That's my house.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Burn her anyway.
You're using coconuts!
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Am I right?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
All right!  What do you want?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
You're a liar.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Come Here.
I'm invincible!
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Now what happens?
Who ... Who breaks out?
What?
What?
Too late.
Where?
Oh, shut up.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Bring out your dead!
Thanks very much.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
But I don't like her.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Castle Anthrax?
Well, she's got a point.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
What are you doing?!
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You should have someone look after you.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Mother....
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Mama...
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
That can wait till the weekend.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Do you hunt?
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
So...?
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
You are well?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
What are those?
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
We're going to lose.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
What's her excuse this time?
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
How long has he been this sick?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Ma'am?
Why is he not here?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
How the hell did you do that?
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Has anyone seen Greg?
Nick...
Something's happened to them.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
We can't reach that!
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
What did he do to you?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Mom?  You're alive...
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So how do I start?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
What do you mean "you know"?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
It will work out.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
So, what did they say?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
I...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
That's okay.
There was an accident. I came here.
A car ... a car accident.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Yes?
Number 17.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
Okay.
Strange to be calling yourself.
What's wrong with that?
"Really?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
No, we don't.
Yes, Sir.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Palmdale.
No...
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
What are you doing ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
He hired you to build this place ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Be very, very quiet...
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
But, he's...
When you are ready.
You did.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
What was that ?
Will he make it out ?
What's next ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Was that the Old Man ?
The power went out in half the park.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Really ? On a date ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
I'm talking to you asshole !
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
People said she looked like me.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Okay, no problem.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
No nuns, got it.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
I will. How's Shelly?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Thanks.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I'm glad you're here.
Special effects?
And she saved it.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Hi.
I know that.
My mother can't have any more kids.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Hello.
I guess you have.
Thanks
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Vada.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
You ratted on my mother??
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boyfriend?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Come and get it.
What's he smoking?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Write me a poem?
Wow!
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Maybe.
He was caressing.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
It would be fantastic.
He's so tiny.
Really?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Keep your voice down!
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Can't you see it?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Kinda like men.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Rock?
Kiss me.
I ahh, better go.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
How's it going chef?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Dad?
Goodnight Vada.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
He's okay isn't he?
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Who's that?
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
I would.
Sure.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Daddy??!?!?!
Where's Daddy?
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
Where's your bike?
Hmmmm, interesting.
You have no personality.
Sorry.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Jump in the water!!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like this?
Close your eyes.
You better not either.
What?
What?
You don't miss much.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You flew all the way h...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Zit cream?
Ben Gay.
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
What else did he tell you...
Don't you have to be somewh...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
How about...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
He'll see right through it.
I think he's been fired.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
No accents today.
Will she like it?
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
Does that make it right...
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got the money?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
What did you say your name was?
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
That's what he wants.
It's on National television, Barnett.
President?
You're kidding.
Mr. Green?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Did you see who that was?
You know anything about the stations here?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
How do you know?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
You got a place to stay?
What kind?
Mom?
I don't know his first name.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
When did you start singing?
How long have you been with them?
And before?
Do you ever do any writing?
I'm not sure. Where?
I don't know who you are.
Oh.
Oh?
When did you think it would happen?
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Hello.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
An album.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Sorry I'm late.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Probably a little too long.
Come on.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Say something.
Do you have a back up.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
I admire them.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Roger, no.
Roger?
What the hell happened to you?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
It's gonna be beautiful.
But how can you say that?
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Give her a beer.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
What d'you want?
I don't know. He's your boy.
How 'you doing?
Don't say much, do you?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Yes, aren't you?
That's right.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Let's go, Duff.
But I would like to see you again.
How old is your boy?
What's he like?
Hi.
How did it go?
Thank you.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What's wrong?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't, Duff.
Don't deny me, Duff.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
Don't do that!
I don't think that'll happen.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
We was just leavin', fellows.
Wouldn't have known you.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Want me to hold the light for you?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
How often does he get like that?
How often is that?
Come on, Pop.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
How 'you gonna live?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Now you stay put!
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
You're hurt...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
What's an A.I.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Yeah, well it's working.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Tell me the words.
What elders?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Yo.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
What about the route to the core?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I know who you are.
What is it?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
How long have I been out?
That's not going to help.
It sounds like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Is he going to make it?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Like what?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
What is with this school and prom?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Now this is cute.
How about this?
Hi!
He is totally crunching on you.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Uhh, no.
What if I say no?
That's your story!
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
It was a long time ago -
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Our penguin, right?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I'm alone.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Wow - I-
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Taste it.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Help me with this thing!
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
So, you live around here.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Are you nuts or something?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
I think it's sad...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Here.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Who, Jesse?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Morning.
Hi, guys.
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
You like gymnastics?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Oh God.
Ms. Thompson.
I'm serious.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Who is he?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
We've got work to do.
What was that?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
How is he?
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
We're here.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Okay -- fine.
Floppy, huh?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Nothing.
No, I didn't.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I have thought about you.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
What?
How are you doing?
That's not true.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
You disappeared.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
What does it say?
Does the girl have a name?
Yup.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
By the way -- it's you.
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What happened?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Max.  This is Anna.
Do you ever masturbate?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Cool, huh?
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
Bad news.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
M-m-m-ma'am?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Sorry to have bothered you.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
So do I!
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Whatcha boys playin'?
That's okay, kid...
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long, kid.
So long suckers.
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
What? What?
Did to me?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Lobotomy!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Okay, sucker.
Giving up?
So why are you talking to him?
I'm busting outta this place.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I said out!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Why not?
Big king, too bad...
When?
Yeah, buddy?
Hit me!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
How do ya know that?
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hey, how ya doin'?
You know, I never got your name.
Yeah...
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Good.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
A very large pig.
No.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
You...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
I'd really rather not say.
Do you want me to do it?
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
And she's a knock-out, too.
You were saying...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
There's no such thing.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Really?...
I was hoping for the real thing.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Excuse me?
What looks good?
Scientologist.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
It's still the new year...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Your brother?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
He's heeeeeerrre...
That was really sweet...
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Hi-iii...
Why?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Oh.
How old are you?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
She what?!
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Mm—hmm.
Mm—hmmm.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
It was you, Charley... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
You know how the Sisters are.
I want to be a teacher.
I can get home all right from here—
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Wham... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
You're not sore at me?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
What are you going to do?
I know what you want me to do!
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, no, no... .
Thanks just the same.
My pigeons... .
Every one of 'em... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't get it!
Your gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You can!
Who asked him here?
D 'n D?
You still call it ratting?
What do you think?
So help me God!
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
What's wrong with your shoulder?
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Listen— Nolan—
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What do you mean?
I am--It's our only chance.
You love me then?
What kind of symbol?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
There are others.
You may take her now.
You better hope there is.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
What do you suppose for?
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Glenn Michaels.
Oh, is this Adele?
Lie face down on the floor.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He called the day he escaped.
You were his what, his box?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Just that she got away.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Nice disguise.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
You tell your sister about it?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
You find out?
They look like plain old rocks.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Who?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Who's sitting here?
So you've done this before, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
You know how to use one a these?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
How many was that?
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You don't seem all that scared.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Don't leave me.
Is that how you think of yourself?
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
What were you gonna do with me?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You're not dumb.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
So.  What's your point?
Take your sunglasses off.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
You there?
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
How's it going?
You're a fighter?
You're not my type.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for Maurice.
You like to sit down?
Here?  In this house?
Dad...
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Thank you...
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Good shooting, Danny!
Land of the free...
How could you do this?
Nah, you go on.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
It's tight.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I heard what you did.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Oh, this is Betty.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Do you believe in all of that?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Lucky lady. Hi.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Want me to drive you home later?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Right. I promised my mother.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Just take a look at it. 
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
I thought you were...for a while.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
All right. But this better be good.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
The hat business is in trouble.
He'll win.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Who was that man?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
What?
Out?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
I think so.
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Yes!
Jesus.
Allright. Calm down.
Why, Beckett?
This time. What about next time?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Drew!
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
Whatever.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Take it easy, Walter.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Find a lawyer?
How did they find out?
You survived your first gay party intact.
I've considered that.
Particularly, Charles.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What do you love about it?
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Objection!
Leave that.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Were you pleased with his work?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Don't wanna miss this.
Power cells.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
What do you see? Riddick?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
What?
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
He can pilot?
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Why did I fall on you?
Owens!
Some prophet guy?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
SULEIMAN!
New Mecca....
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
...then we saw this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, what's it look like now?
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
What's her name, anyway?
So much for your nightfall.
Not a star-jumper.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Seal the cave?
Where does the river lead?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Got your sensors?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
No.
Which direction?
Any particular reason?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
What happened?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
All right --
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Lucius.
Gorilla hunters ...
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Sustained.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Of course.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
You want her that much?
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
It's humiliating.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Bunker...
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
But what'd she actually do?
I'll go with you.
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
What are you talking about! 
Merle?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
I didn't like it.
You wanted to see me sir?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
What's the matter?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think you're drunk.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
It might be worth a Martini to you.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
They'll know whether he killed himself.
How did you meet him?
Nice of him.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Bad?
Want to dance?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
In a way.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Mine?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Would I want to?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
If I understand what you meant by that.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
What are your rates?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Got it on you?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
What'll you have, Margo?
So you're not a cop.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Could be.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What are you doing here?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Recently, then.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
Ye have, have ye?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Thank you.
Shall we go?
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
How's Mary?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
I couldn't bear for it to end.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Did she talk about me?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
Not yet you know any of these people?
Blasé and epicene.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
What would you call it?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
How was the beach?
Sorry.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
The hell are they?!
Bye.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
What have you got in mind, General.
What's he got?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
We can reach an understanding on this.
I like your hat.
It's... it's not like that.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Always.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Did you buy some clothes?
The Rex.
You're upset, huh?
Why not?
Was someone rude to you?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
Real genuine guy.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Fuck off.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
What if I lose it?
What did you do to him?
Business.
I got tired of hating my father.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Doing what?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
What!?
Carlos had some great rock.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Kit...
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
What kind of school?
You sure you won't come with me?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I'm just going to my room.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
Having a good time, Vivian?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He will come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I fear I'll never see you again.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
What?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
I only dog paddle.
Probably he means no harm.
Hello.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Have you any money?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
I brought you a special present.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
What?
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Westley's only faking, right?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sir. Sir.
We're really in a terrible rush.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Go in, get after her!
Let me explain-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
You're that smart?
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You guessed wrong.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"By the light, by the light,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Yes sir.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Help!
Assume away!
What did I do?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
It won't run a week!
What are you doing?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Always.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
Not at all!
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
What's your interest?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Please!
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
What should I know?
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
I feel better when you feel better.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Probably on his way back right now.
Stay here.
He didn't come back here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Our Deputy sleeps.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Sorry.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
You're very... kind.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I'm looking for a private island.
Except you.
Why don't you go away?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Phoenix?
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
May I see your license?
Oh?
Barefaced.
It isn't necessary.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
What's that?
What is it?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
There's no hurry. It's early.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I think so.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
We'll be coming to the opening.
But it was really my fault.
Let me go! Let me go!
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
He might get some publicity out of it.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Shall we unpack it?
What are you laughing at?
I've been dreaming about you.
Why?
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
In what sense were they bad?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
What's goin' on?
Are they polar bears, too?
Is her husband sick or something?
That's what she would say herself.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
I am ahead of you.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Well, she's back.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I am not being brutal to her!
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Honey!
Yes, sir.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Is this ill right?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Your baby?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Took your time gettin' here.
Um-m, well...
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
Yes, dear, what is it?
What's the matter with him?
Afraid of the hospital?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
You think it's that good?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
What's the plan?
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
What day is it?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
What's mine say?
Hey...
No, we're stealing.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
General Jim Beam, then.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
He tried to kill us.
Maybe.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pure horse.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
You know what I mean.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
You see that?
You always did have style.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
I...
I'm sorry.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Lando, grab it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Good luck.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Good shot, Red Two.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
There it is!
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Well, I'm sorry.
You!
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
You promise you won't tell?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Janet!
Yes.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You're OK by me.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Want to come again and stay
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
It's Thanksgiving.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
What's funny?
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
...Guess.
D'you really wanna call?
...T-thank you.
Like?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
...Like you?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He got lucky.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Few minutes?
That's ten bucks.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Ya still light seventy.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What was I gonna say?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
How old?
The legs must be goin'.
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Here's the card?
Whatta' those?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Yo, Paulie.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
What's ya sister like to do?
It don't bother me none.
How ya feelin'?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
What was <u>that</u>?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Does it hurt?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Hold on a second.
Now what?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Aah!
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Two bits.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Juliet!
I come for my lady Juliet.
Goodnight.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
I have.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Nurse.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Why did you do that?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
I don't know.
Well I don't!
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
What in bloody hell is going on?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Do I need to repeat myself?
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Who are you?  IRA?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
He's company.
And more importantly --
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Bullshit!
Sent it where?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
A means to an end, is that it?
Nobody's going to do that!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
You shoot alright.
Long enough to shoot back.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
How did you know?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Clearly.
What's this?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
You have to stop doing that!
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
I told you, I quit.
Why's that?
You put everything on the line because you...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
What are we going to do?
Well someone's gonna find them.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
It's the right thing to do.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You said that last time!
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Oh Jesus...
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Dwayne's dead.
Well, I don't know...
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Yeah?  So?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Yeah I'm fine.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
You're worth every last penny.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Why does that bother you?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
And what's that?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I guess we can get started.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Hello.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
C?
A lot of men come in here?
She's not his type.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Why?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I didn't know you were coming.
How's work?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
This whole place?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
This isn't right...
The band has been playing over an hour.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Yeah, that's right.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Oh, you American?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Hello.
Where are you going?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Follow the Rich White Man?
You sound like that all the time.
He'll be back soon.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
She saved our lives.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
Red Dragon.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We made it, man.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
What is your name?
Shut up!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Good job.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
Shortcut?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You like it?
Want some?
What?!
Which one?
Like that.
Not anymore.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Yo, Johnson...
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You sonuvabitch.
Yes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I will not have friends in America.
I'm not running.
Right.
Yes.
You look awful.
Really?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Your two cinnamon rolls.
They made me put my hat back on.
Getting nervous?
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Too much.
I think so.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Always a mood killer.
No.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
But I'm weird.
He's going to be the pastor?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Let's go.
You okay?  I'm closing.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
I'll wait.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Who is it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
About forever.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
It's not true, but it feels true.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Right.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
But he saw you, right?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Sure you do.
Hi.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
All righ...
What was it that made you know?
Where's your mom?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You'll find out.
You'll like it.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
What?!
Does red pepper go under R or P?
What?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Like do you believe in heaven?
It's a sign.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Hi.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Oh.
Is he there?
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
What's the matter?
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
Alone?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
You mean you're ready to give up?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You know I don't think that.
No ...
Well, if that's possible ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
What can I do for you?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
You don't understand.
Oh. Hi.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
How far out of town?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
It gets me through the day.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Really, I don't want to.
Where to?
I'm hurting.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
What's this?
What the hell is that?
By not disgracing her memory!
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
I've got a hot one.
No last name?
Danny, I'm touched.
I was getting to it.
What're your taking down?
You've got no choice.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
What? Is it bad?
I thought you'd be happy.
He's the only one I told.
What's on the other end of this thing?
What's that smell?
When is the deal going down?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Where's Bubba?
Yes, sir.
Sir?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Last I knew.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Y'all come back.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
It looks like a Renoir.
Good luck, Captain.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
You?  Leading a squad?
Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
You think they'll be alright?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
Oh, yeah?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What are we going to do?
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Up.  We're moving out.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Goddamn it!
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Yes, Private.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
This evening is over.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
I'll be in my office.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Then what's love?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Please?
Alright.
What does it say?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
I don't feel anything.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
Why?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Visit her at the home.
You like it?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
They really applauded you today honey.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
You should be.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Lloyd?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
You're not listening to me.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
What happened to you?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Busy?
Are you busy on Saturday?
So we can finally talk?
Sure I do.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
After work?
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
It did?
Did you talk to Corey?
You told your dad?
What do you want?
Okay.
Good to know.
How's it going?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
PAIN!
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Thanks Lloyd.
No, really.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Certainly.
Later for you, Luke.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
It's not a charade, all this?
What?
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
What are you doing?
What others?
That'd be fine.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
Don't ever do that to me again.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
Four hundred, four fifty -
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
Have you checked the...
He's broken his pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Shit.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Cotton.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
It helped me realize one thing.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
What are you going to do?
No way.
About what?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
She's got guards with her.
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Who is this?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Yes, goddammit!
I don’t know.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Time to change numbers again?
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
How many guys they have on you?
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
Do you want to die?
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Take it off.
I'll be right back.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Jesus.  Hello?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Yeah.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Jesus Gale what happened?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Where are you Dewey?
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
They found another note?
You used to say that was our strength.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Your life?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Geez.
Nobody said she was an actor.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
I know!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
No.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
You're dead!
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
No I need to call you. Just you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Dude. What are you doing here?
I thought she was dead.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Close call.
You know that's not true.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Yes.
I don't know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
No.
Why do you want to know my name?
Gotta go.
What do you want?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Please don't hurt him.
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
Now for the real question.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
So is Dewey your real name?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Did you reach my Dad?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
She's tough.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
That fish smelled strong.
Where is she?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I want to talk to you.
Please. You owe me.
You owe my mother.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Are you alone in the house?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
I heard screaming.
Don't come any closer.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
She's saving herself for you.
Which is you...
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
You've left unfinished business before.
It's none of my business anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
What the hell's going on?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
What's so exciting?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You should be thanking me.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
It could be nothing.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
This is the one thing.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Does this make it with you?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
How much money do you have?
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
Think about it...
We could use about fifty more men here.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
What is it?
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
How long have you lived here?
But Mose Harper said...
You askin' me to clear out now?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Well, the reward still stands...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Yes, sir.
Nothing for you to see.
Easy on that!
Say it. We're beat!
Good night...Laurie...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
You ask her!
Stay out here.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Was your niece about their age?
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
They never find that girl.
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Where are you going?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
Who's that?
What?
She was old.
Maybe an animal.
Martin, what-
How did you get me out of there?
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
I really hate to bother him, but...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Do I look like it that much?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Mrs. Straub!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
You didn't tell her!
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ned…I know…I know
Wait!  Will you desist!
How much?
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
When?
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
So what do we do?
Where is the play?
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Do you know it?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
I feel a scene coming on.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
We are lost.
The show must … you know
And yours?
The daughter of his enemy.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Not ready? Where is she?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Your Majesty
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Even your play.
I know how to fight!
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
My lady Viola.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady VIOLA.
Good morning, my lord!
Where did you learn how to do that?
Wait there.
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
What do you think?
He made it clear.
He's still here.
How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?
What is this?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Nothing.
I want to secure it.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
I don't know them.
Well, is it?
Just one thing.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
And you like it?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Did you know --
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
-- which is --
So?
You want me to kick it open?
Alex.
Don't.
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
Be careful.
Love and happiness for ever.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Later. But first -- him.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
We could put it somewhere.
Now you thought of that, not me.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Don't you ever stop?
It's OK. There's no problem.
Downstairs.
Two?
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
Yes.
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
I'm sorry.
So let's go.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
What?
What do we do here, David?
Here.
But they sneer, don't they?
You must be Hugo.
For what?
The human condition.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Same as everyone else.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Do you think George is a fairy?
That kid... the hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Yeah, I think so.
She did?
You're late, George.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What about?
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
But aren't you...
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
You going to answer it?
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I asked you first.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah...
No.
You are.
Wonderful woman.
Pardon me?
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
You're late, George.
Jesus...
How long you had this?
I'm sure.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Baby...
One of my few virtues is discretion.
It'll ruin everything.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- don't you want to --
-- gee...
What are you looking at?
-- yeah.
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
Well then what are you trying to do-
So I'm saying it...
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Honey?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Yeah, baby...
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
A friend dropped me off.
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
That was him.
Yes.
Baby, don't do this --
What're you here for?
You need a cut.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I know it, I know it.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
She's nothing but a whore.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
I was too old.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
You and your touchy investors.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Here.
-- you phony asshole --
That's right.
I am? I mean why?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
You're really a love -- you sure?
How much?
What?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Why don't you ask for another one?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
You're going?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- there's not much room --
Dad?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Are you having a good time?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
No I ain't.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
I won't make any noise.
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Oh,
No.
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
What sort of injury did he have?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Grady?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Who?
She eh... interferes.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Perfect for a child.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
He's still asleep.
Get him out of here?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Yes...
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Wendy...
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Only in a very general way.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Right there.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Yeah? Really?
Really.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
And I'm tearful!
His ashes?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Thanks.  A lot.
Sure.
Oh, girls.
Oh my! 
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
What is it, Mary?
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
What?
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
What?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Miss Van Cartier.
And all those like you.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Is this all the food I get?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
What are you doing here?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
I just need a few more weeks,
What'd she say?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I am?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
There she is!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
A sweater.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
Where?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Certainly not.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
It is sacrilege!
I will not allow it.  I will not!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
No, I couldn't...
We are leaving.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
We should not go much further in this murk.
How are you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
My suitor?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
These scars.  How did you get them?
People have put their trust in you.
It is only me.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Where are we going?
Ichabod...
Use caution.
Where?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
What... what are you doing?
Go home.
She is guilty.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what, by God?
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle!
Sure, I guess.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
But maybe just for awhile --
What are all them books?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
How do you know?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Where'd you get them flowers?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It was fun, anyhow.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
You all right, Mama?
Huh?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
You walk fast, don't you?
I'm ye boy.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Do they know about you?
You scared me.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Okay.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Let's just go, Marsha.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
What!
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Like me, too.
Jesus, what happened to you?
What'll it be, Auggie?
And what about for you?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Are you closed?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
But they're all the same.
Hey, man, good to see you.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Two, right?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Like what?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
So I can get my job back.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
So what's the time?
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, it might be.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Fries?
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
None.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
It is.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Closer to eight.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
Did you write that column?
You don't believe in God anymore.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
How long you have this detail?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
That's when he fell.
You think so?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You want me to say that.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
No spare.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Improved...how?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Wanna see my driver's license?
You're welcome.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Okay. 
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
With me?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
You've flipped your wig!
Where are we running, Joe?
This way, Daphne.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What happened?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
How can we?  We're broke.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
With ME?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like when?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe -
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Sugar?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
What'll I tell him?
OH!
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
We don't have to run.
Josephine -
I always did.
How did those holes get there?
I was it.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
About that roadhouse -
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Anything today?
Oh?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
Well, here we are.
Running away?  From what?
Put it here.
Then why did you take this job?
Bingo?
Brains aren't everything.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Happy days.
Thanks, honey.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Which one is yours - the big one?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Josephine.
Guess!
Been waiting long?
I seem to be out of gas.
Love it.  Which way?
Champagne?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
I don't want to bore you.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Is that anything?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Good night.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Really?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Daphne -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
PLEASE!
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Refresh my memory.
I should get going.
It was such a long time ago.
Say something. Please.
Huh?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Crikey.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
That was a long time ago.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Brilliant.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
I’m sorry?
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
Mmm.
You quitting?
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Yes.
Are you asking me if I’m gay for pay?
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Is this for last night?
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
What?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Hi.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
You pawned it.
You want I nut him in the boat?
You want me to let him in?
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That does it...
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Where's everybody?
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
But, Nathan--
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Dude!
Is it Cartman's mom?
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Who the hell made up that law?!
Hey Cartman.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Goodnight, honey.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mom...
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
What was that word, young man!?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Ber dada!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rmph rm!
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
What's that?
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Nowhere.
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
This is sweet!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Stan!
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
I'm needing lunch.
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
But I-
How is the children's progress?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
You'd fuck your uncle!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Hello, Conan!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
What's going on Terrance?
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
What is it?
Oh, thank you.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
What did you say to me?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Idiot...
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Look at this...Jesus.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
I can't let you do that.
You're ready for the real thing?
Explosive?
Do you want some advice?
What's that?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
What is it?!
I'm homesick.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Is it safe for human transport?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Heh, heh, heh.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Yeah, basement bingo.
I hate fuckin' opera.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
- canker sore.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Think he bought it?
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Need some advice, huh.
Where'd you get this ball?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
No...
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Don't tell me, John.
How's that?
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Do you have a boyfriend?
What's plan B?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Come on, bargain with me.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Where are you going?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
You're really pissing me off.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Get out of there!
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Nobody move.
Nice work, Captain sir.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Norman, please!  Don't!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Then why am I here?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
I see it.
It's not sucking, sir.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
You don't know that.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
A half a mile long?
I'd also like it noted --
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
We had considered it.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
From the sphere?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Yeah, it was awful.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?  Why...
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You, me and Harry?
Four days?
You fixed my suit?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
Diphenyl parlene.
Ulcers.
A synthetic opium analogue.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Doesn't say.
I'm sorry.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Someone did.
You're lying --
That's when you went in the sphere.
That's bullshit.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
You hear that?
Well, what's your theory?
For who?  The fish?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Then what is it?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
You holding up alright?
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
I can't believe that, Harry.
No.  I didn't say that.
Getting anywhere with those?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Hold on.
Her legs are in the way.
How's that working out, by the way?
There is one possibility.
What does Norman already know?
English?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
What'd you say?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
He wasn't feeling well.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Well, he's polite.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, we'll see...
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
Are you all right?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Well, I practice a lot...
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
And you?
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
I don't believe it !
So what are you doing later ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Good for you.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
None at all... We won.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You talk to Carl ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
You don't look very happy to see me.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where'd it come from ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Cover me.
What's that, Diz ?
Way to go, amigo !
Hey, Diz...
What frequency ?
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Mr. Rasczak.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Best in the Fleet !
On whose authority, Corporal ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Yes.
What does that mean?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Programming ready?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Captain, what's the next move?
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Mr. Spock?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Not for us?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I have one, but they lost it.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Goodbye.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...such a pleasant sound.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
...lost the screw...
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
What've you got?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
...yes.
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
No, that's true.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Pelting down out there.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
But it'll stop the movie.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
I have to tell you something...
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Wat...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
I will.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
How big is this horse?
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Mornin, sister.
What else?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
No, you're absolutely r...
Are you Okay?
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
What's his name?
No.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
This is Joe White.
I know that...
...I...
Wally...
And you know what...?
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
You show Claire these sketches?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Kiss my ass.
Where you off to?
Why?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
I'm looking for the writer.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Grace...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I want to make a good film.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I've got a date.
What did you say to them...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
It's lovely.
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
We got the permit.
Yeah?
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
You think so?
Where are we?
Ben!  What's wrong?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Wow.  Who's that for?
And don't tell her I told you.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
What if he's kidnapped?
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Help me here...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
No.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Okay.  These are good.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Called him.  We set an ap...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's a huge moment in their life --
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
What did you do?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I have a snoop.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Jackie?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
My boss.
Look, you've never liked me...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
You bet you are.
I don't, but...
Oh, my God.
She's devastated.
And you said...?
So.  Hopeful.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Looks nice enough to m...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Hey.
You know...Stanley...
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Really? How many?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Why was he on Death Row?
No, you don't.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready.
Don't even joke about that!
We used pull.
It's all about who you know.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
The same. Same as what?
Come here, give me a hug!
You're not.
You have beautiful skin.
It's over there.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Fuck me hard!
No, not really.
I dunno...
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Who is this?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
You know...I like you.
You want some?
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I said I'll lead.
Now what?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Are the labs in operation?
Enjoying the tour so far?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
Come on, drink up.
What about Cooper--where is he?
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Drop the anchor!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
I have your word, Mister President?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That about right?
What shall we drink to, sir?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think we'd cheat?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Then there's no chance for recall?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Roger, maintain.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Check.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Primary arming switch.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
What's your point, Lothar?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Check target approach.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Who's that?
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Um-hm.
In Group?
That was really great.
Typical male.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey!
Yup.
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, he's not with a girl.
That sounds so depressing.
Fuck it!
What she doin' in the van, man?
She's dead?
Bullshit.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Will you stand up for me?
Come on. Inside.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
I'd like to.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Hi.
Two-fifty.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
What?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Was that supposed to be me?
Yes, I stand for -
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Come on.
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
Hey, Pony.
No, it's not...
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
Get off my property!
Get off my roof!
Ready?
No, this has everything to do with you.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
You're not serious.
Yeah, come on, play it.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm moving.
No, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Just one?
So where are you?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Hi, Jack.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
You want us to help you pick up?
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Give me your coat.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
It's from hunger.
Name dropper.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
If I could be of any help...
I've been hoping to run into you.
I didn't.
I had a teacher like that once.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Gordon Cole?
Or shall I call my servant?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I need some money right now.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Hold me tighter.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
When did he say it, Norma?
He must be quite a guy.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
This room has not been used for a long time.
Whose room was this?
How come?
What doctor?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Got a title?
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Paramount studios.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
I think I'd better keep it.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I bet they do.
Oh no, not you again.
Nurse! Nurse!
Hey, where you going?
What about my proposal?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Someone's chasing him.
Yes.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I'd rather not talk about it.
She did that deliberately.
Your hair looks the same.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Nigel, get lost.
You're wasting your breath.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Where is inner space?
What is this place?
Shouldnt've done that.
Others?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Yeah? What do you want?
Tuesday.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You look wonderful.
You...um...you never got married?
I just can't stand this.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
How many sugars?
The boss wants to see you.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Wipe 'em out?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
When?
What?
Is this blackmail?
Is this whitemail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Everything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
You want to mess with Superman?
No, we're just going down.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Oh, Superman!
Okay? Goodbye.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
She's not his mama either.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Actually, yes.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Oh Clark, no!
I was right. you are Superman.
I want to.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
You do?
Everything on it?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Mush!  Mush!
I like trees.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Where?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
He has powers as we do . . .
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
You must be freezing.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this . . . Superman?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
General --- ?
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
No Paris?
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Awesome!
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
I'm not going anywhere.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
Are there any more at home like you?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
I'm telling you, I was there.
It wasn't a trick!
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Nuts. He made it.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready?
No news is not good news. Y'know
You're not going to hit me?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I mean the other one!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Two.
It's a ...baby.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
No! You couldn't imagine -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, the kickback story...
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh.
How much do you weigh?
Do you like pink?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him steady employment --
Is that real enough for you?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally.  That's right.
And what does he do again?
But you said...
Say hi to Zoe.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
So what brings you out tonight?
Because it's what we have to do.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
What time's he coming home?
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Because I have to.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
From what?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
He knows that?  Billy?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You heard what Abbott said?
What do you think?
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
You want a cup of tea or something?
No.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
It's like a song.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
When?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Here we go.
That's not news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I tested positive.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Yes.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Did she accept?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told him that?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Can I come out?  No.
Uh huh.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Yeah!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
This sort of thing!
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Why me...?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Steve, I...
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
No good.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Torque wrench please.
Alriight!!  My man!
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive for a minute.
Easy money!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
John, get out of the way!!
I love you.  I always will.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
Is it safe for them here?
On Furtwängler.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
I'm very sorry.
Where you from, David?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
Major, Major... he's here ...
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Did you call someone you knew?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
How?
Who warned you?
What did Goering say?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I have illegitimate children.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
One of your people told me.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Anything else?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Do you understand?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
And you're from the future too?
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Reese...you got a first name?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Thanks a lot.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
So much pain.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Send a unit.
Call her.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I could fight you on this.
Are you finished?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Do you know what to do?
There's got to be a flashlight.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
There's a ladder here.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That's classic.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
What exactly do you do?
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
What do you think you're doing?
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
I have to get to the airport...
Happy Birthday, man.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
For you.
Trust me.  Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
Yeah, almost...
It's them.  They did this.
The phone's dead.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Get rid of them.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
Drive in.
I need the police.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Thank you.
You did?  How is he?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Your ex-wife.
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
That could have been worse.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Well, this lot is full!
Yeah.
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell!
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Like she smelled it too?
What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Get a blanket!
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
Is there something about the house?
Why?
Yes.
Why?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Jeez.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
Is it over?
Are you sure?
Nell, what happened?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Am I a thing?
It's not a compliment.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I like the colors.
How they goin', kid?
What kind?
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
You're kiddin' me, right?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Has he?
That was one of them?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Same.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Weren't you on a television series?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Are you serious.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Fancy it?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Of the deal, man.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
You do?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
He's expecting you?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Pleasure.
What.
...Yes?
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
No problem!
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
All right.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Where you going?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I don't know what's going on. I--
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Will anyone else say they knew?
How did you get into the store?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Not guilty, your honor...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Ed, how're you holding up?
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Did you make that up?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Frank.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
You don't got a headache?
...I'm Crane.
Doesn't bother me.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Sweet Jesus!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What's that?
What's that doing here?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
I hope you liked it.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
What's that?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Something tried to get into this room!
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Where is that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Shut them up!
Oh no.  I smell it.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
What was it?
Genetic damage?
Wounded?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
What happened?
For what?
I don't believe it.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I thought you were in a hurry.
Welcome.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
That's correct.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
What's he doing?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
What're we doing here, Truman?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
It'd be an adventure.
What did you want?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
They're coming.  Any minute.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Good.  Good.
Do you live around here?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
Yes.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
You follow me out here for a reason?
How'd you find me?
Who sent you?
He just let it explode.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
That would be my guess.
No. I haven't.
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
Had you.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What did you find?
How was it contracted?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
Where would they be going?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
This is weird, Mulder.
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I have. I did. It's done.
Scully...
We're going to the morgue.
Agent Mulder --
What are you doing?
Where's Scully?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
My god...
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I'd be there for him.
Nothing.
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Evil.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
They're hungry.
Thank you.
What now?
Oh no... No you don't.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Nervous?
How's the patient.
What about the cat?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
You were awfully good.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
Tell me about him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
I wish I knew.
Have you seen Calloway?
...you know.
...again.
Harry.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
They are - private - letters.
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
You a friend of Lime's?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
A parrot bit me.
So would I.
Fifty yards right down there.
It wouldn't work.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
Do you know his number?
They wouldn't know me.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Seems exciting.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hmm.
Unwise, Holly...
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...your address?
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Kurtz.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
No.
Third Man.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
He tried to borrow money from us.
Exactly.
We lost our key.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
You think?! Based on what?
No one follows that midrash.
What's a fascist?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
You coming?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Is he a Nazi?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Bigger and better.
When can I see you?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
It looks a little like a swastika.
The sex is better.
What's it about?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
And? WHat did you notice?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Who? How would I know him?
How do you reconcile the two?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you get the fucking number?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
Hello...?
Tell it to Hitler.
Not too fast.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Are you an artist?
You remember Miriam....
How did you know they were Jews?
You missed on purpose.
Leary?
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Did the driver really freeze?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
He can learn.  He is learning.
How did it happen?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
Where did you get that?
It isn't lit yet.
... What's your name again?
I dove 315 feet!
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Enzo?
Your mother?
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Why?
Two years younger than you.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
He doesn't like us.
Anybody can have a bad day!
... How long was I asleep?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
Don't you have a heater?
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
You jumped in?
... No?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
... And the new stereo.
What are they for?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Who... Who is that?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Okay, what's the information?
Anything else?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Mmm———yes.
Is he in love with you?
This is for "mama and the kids."
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Sure, I like my leopards
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
I want him to lock me up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
See you tomorrow —-
He will be waiting...
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's about the leopard.
It could be a man.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
It was you.
State hunters?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
You're too good to me.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I got into a little crap game.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
We stood here once before.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
That might depend on where you’re going.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Laurence!
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Are we understood?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Are you all right?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Where is that?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Crow what?
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
By your Austrian?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Then find another way.
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Why?
So, what are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Who’s the money man?
Ever seen him before?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
And who does Friedman work for?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Must I speak to you in French?
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
What happens now?
Let’s go.
At what time will you be available?
What are you talking about?
Five to three. You’re early.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Evening. Table for one?
I’m sorry...
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
What you gonna do? Kill me?
They lost their son. Why?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
What do you mean?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I would like some fresh straw.
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Why?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Your majesty, I really think you...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Is it long and hanging down?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Do you know how to count?
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Who... who are you...?
I don't know... I thought...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I never lied!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
They won't come anyway.
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
You think you are ready now?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Then... why are you here so often?
Beautiful.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
For what? For my tie?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
And suppose they take the table away?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
That's better than yesterday.
I know.
It's not funny.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
But I want to help, I want to.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
What's your work?
What's happening?
What about you?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Yes, why not.
You don't want to learn.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
What?
What on?
What does she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
You got a bag or somethin?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
You're late.  Where you been?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
I thought you blew all your money.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Raise 500.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
I don't even know you.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Hooker!
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why not?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Cheer up, darling.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Any luck?
What?
Mind if I look around?
I can't.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Come on in.
Hello, Dorothy. 
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
I never saw him before.
Nothing.
Have you got a pistol permit?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
He's holding out on you.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
He telephoned me today.
What are you going to do?
Why, you said...
Who's that man?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I'm not telling anyone.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
My wife.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
All right - you didn't.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
So it's you he was after!
You got types?
Isn't that my drink?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
But it's Christmas now.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Who gave it to you?
Finished with these?
Why don't you?
What are you going to do?
Nick!
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Is that true?
I hope you're well.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
Where are you going?
What's it say?
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
He's not so--
What kind of mine?
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
You're out of your mind.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Just keep quiet.
So you can give us away?
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
What!?  What!?
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They're not going to--
She okay?
What do we do with the Humvee?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
This.  Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Where the hell is it!?
If they land--
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Get up and dig.
He's not going to leave us.
We should head Northeast.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
First Wes, now you?
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
What do you figure it is?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What did you say?
Slip out your M-16.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
To where?
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
How do we do that?
Epps.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Jaeger?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Iraqis.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
What the hell are you doing!?
Maybe we should give him some water.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
I can't hear him.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
HUMMMM.....
What did you get?
When?
Now?
I don't know.
I haven't done anything.
Look, food!
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
I thought you were through with it!
Who?  Who's leaving?
You're in violation.
What are you doing here?
We've lost SEN!
Remember this...?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
And you are...?
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
Where did you get this?
Now wait just a fucking-
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
This is where the van was parked.
So cut both.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
Good, now the other side.
Something round, two wires ...
What... ?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
You got it.
Any word?
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
C4, plastic explosive.
Alright!
Jesus...
Why are we stopping here?
Drop it.
I want to work this.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What about the ballistics report?
What the hell's going on?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Vice... Jesus.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Next week we work the park.
You don't fish.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
It don't work-
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
What?
I'll do it.
What's this?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Niente!</u>
And harems ... ?
I don't want to see you at all!
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Two weeks and three days.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Very well, m'sieu.
Monescu.
The tennis player?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
But, Lily--
Yes...?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Beautiful specimen.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
It's disgraceful!
Good night. 
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Yes, Gaston?
It could have been marvelous ...
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
To me he seems rather nervous.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Right!
But you're the more intelligent one.
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Shit.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
She's not on the starboard side either.
We're too late.
Is this in any way unclear?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You're a good liar.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
How cold?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Mr. Dawson, I --
It is that simple.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
And these were drawn from life?
A whole ten cents?!
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Jack, must you go?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Are you nervous?
It's bad.
This is horseshit.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You jump, I jump, right?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
April 14, 1912.
Is your stateroom alright?
It's been 84 years...
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You'll excuse me. 
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
No-o!
Aces full.
Could I see you a minute?
I thought you were one of my friends.
Nice lines--
Like her paint job?
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Don't be a c-a-t.
When?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Thank you, sir. 
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
How's your mother feeling?
I thought you were a sucker--
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
What?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
I didn't--
Am I a member of this club?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
How much did you lose?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
Why don't you leave me alone?
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
Not because of Ned.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
That's the truth--every single word!
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I'm all right.
I'll explain later--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
A peace officer... Impressive man
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
That's the rumor.
That's just my game.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
How you feeling, Doc?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Since when is faro a business?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
A which?
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
What is it?
Just doesn't, that's all.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Wyatt!  My God...
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Well how do we look?
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
I just got it fixed.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
That a fact?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Look pretty rough.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
How did you get this number?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Briefly.
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
What - no lust for adventure?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Your new car. 
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Do you feel better now?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
It must do something.
... Shoelaces?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
She married a hockey player.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
No?
This has got to be a mistake.
And number two?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Sakwa!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
What is HE doing here?
How sweet.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
What, are you having another party?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Good morning.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You invited me.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
What are you doing?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
To infinity and beyond!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Next stop...
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Can!
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
What happened to you?
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Hold on, Woody!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Something's screwy here.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
You are a liar!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
They're getting bigger.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This is ludicrous.
Reach for the sky!!
I'm red this time.
I can manage.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
He made that. In his off hours.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're only a young thing.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Stop it!
Finn ...
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
I'm Melanie.
You're well built; how old are you?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
This is different.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How long have you known?
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
You all right?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
...How old are you?
How are your grades?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
Are you getting this on tape?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You first.
That's good coke.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
A group of us are going out tonight.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
You should feel good about this.
Does this offer include my partner?
My work keeps me young.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
I'm sorry.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
It's a scandal, Franco.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Can I see you again?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Well, it isn't.
Happy birthday.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Following the game at all?
You take the test?
Now remember --
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
Who wrote it?
I don't rate that at all.
Did he -- you know?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
But you don't have the money?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's the great outdoors.
It's fresh air.
How's it going with Gail?
How long is it?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
We go for a walk.
Qual se tu?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Bob?
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
What is it you seek?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
How do you know?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
It would appear we are too heavy.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
We must change our course at once.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
No special conditions?
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Each man's pain is unique.
You did break in.
My dinner.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Did he say why?
Of what?
They'll start to soon enough.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
You said it.
Flynn?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
User requests are what computers are for.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Hey... you guys OK?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
What's goin' on?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
New guy...
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
What is it?
I'm done.
You seem fine now.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Harry!  Where are you!
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What's the plan?
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
He's got it.
My husband is a good man.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
Why did you continue to see him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Are we going to die?
17 years.
No.  But I wanted to.
What are you going to do?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
What does she do?
Yeeaoowww!!
Beat it.
What?
Boris and Doris?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Worse than Cairo?							*
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You'll call me then?
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Like it?
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Do you get paid a lot?
Four hundred bucks.
You know when you sat behind me?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You mean she got a bad batch?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
That dazzling imagination.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I do.
Where you goin', honey?
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
I'm hip.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Live with what?
You'd really do that?
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
It's great to hear from you.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
No. No, you don't.
He wants to talk ya.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You gotta hold this for me.
Put it in your pants.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
How do you know? You been there?
No.
Women will want to get to know you...
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
That's him.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
The guy was a total fruitcake.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What....???
JOSE!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Uh, that message...me?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He was fully sedated!
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Hey!  You there!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Nothing.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
One way, or round trip?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Nope.  Darrell.
You own this place?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much?
How much!?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
No, I've got it.
Yes, I have.
Thank you, John.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
You love him?
I'm guessing no.
Is it pretty?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
If you want.
Let's do it here.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
What?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John, throw me the keys.
The trunk.  It's locked.
Someone will find me.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Would you?
Why would I kill her?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Now what can I do for you?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You know what I mean.
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
I came for Grace.
It's the truth, Jake.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you babbling about?
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I wasn't doing anything.
Now, what's this?
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Kids.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Hey!  You there!
Oh, Jesus.
Hell no!
I think I've heard that before.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I wasn't doing anything.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
But you was going to fight for me.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Will he be back soon?
But he's dead.
Hey.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Yeah, but it was shot.
What you want?
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the sheriff.
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You've been around.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Are there snakes out here?
I don't know how.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You mean the Shaman?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
In <u>cash</u>?
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
I can't see it.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Hope is a four-letter word.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Help me, Grace, help...
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Proceed.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
When was the last time I wore pink?
Oh shit...
I've come to a decision.
I remember you.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What about the game?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
What do you want?
Yes.
I don't know what you're asking?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Quick.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's doing well today.
Yeah?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to work out.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
I'm not scared.
I know now.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Rain's coming.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He tell you where them others is?
Scouting?
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Books. He's my biographer.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
The... Duck of Death.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
What?
What'd Ned say?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
William Munny, yeah.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh.
Jesus!
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Get some sleep, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Wha... what f-for?
You could have it. All of it.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
He musta been movin' right along.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He hit you?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen him.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
What is it, son?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
More.
His pistol must of jammed.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
We done that stuff.
Well, suppose he does?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah.
Who ?
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I love you.
That's enough, Edie.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
What are we gonna do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Get out.
You watch your mouth.
Fenster and Hockney?
What is this?
How are you, Keaton?
with what?
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
What call?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
You're not safe on your own.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Yes.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Objection!
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I am on the staff of...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
I read the hospital report on your client.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
What is it?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Exception!
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I'm a lawyer.
What happened...?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Thank you.
Are you out of your mind...?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
She told me.
What?
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Another, Frank . . . ?
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Will you have dinner with me?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
I like that one.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You want me to dress like her?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Can't you see?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Do you remember where you were?
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
One shouldn't live alone.
I hope we will, too.
No.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
Where were you born?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You believe that I love you?
Is there something I can do for you?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
How's your love life, Midge?
I think I can lick it.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Out!
Around.
Yeah.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What have you been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
How ya doing?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Name one.
This is pathetic.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
What?
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Where's the candy?
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
My god.
Okay. Hi.
Who?
Is everything okay?
No I don't.
What's your fucking point?
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
We need padded chairs.
Nobody knows she's here.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
I said, what have we done?
What?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Just do it.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
My what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Photographer?
Why did you forget the tent check?
You can't play around with these tent people.
How do you figure?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Charles Moore for instants.
He's weird.
You expect more what?
That's absurd.
How much?
Will you please call the chair people?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well you should.
Yeah. Nesting.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hello.
Where are you?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
You fucked a prostitute?
What?
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
It means she's insecure.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where's Boyd?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
You alright?
I guess.
Yeah?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
"You Send Me."
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Good times.
Are there many windows?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
What do you mean?
Never.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Let me pass!
Me?
Ramona! Ramona!
She's mad.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Yes. Why?
How are you today?
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What's going on, Moncho?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She looks like a sick marrow!
Have I slept long?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
What's the assignment?
Think you can do it?
Enough to level an entire city block.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
How does he know who I am?
HEY!!!
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
It was you, wasn't it?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
You ready for this?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Who said that?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
What does that mean?
What's the problem?
Real effective security...
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
How did you find out about the toxin?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
See something?
Find out anything?
How's your pulse?
What do we do now?
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
It's the White House.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
...The Albanian Campaign...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
...what's the Long View?
Our adopted land...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
What are we going to do?
Oh, God...
How's your wife?
Stanley, you can't do this....
"...where's my pill..."
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
What's on your mind?
Would you go to War to do that? 
...Yes.
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Is there a press conference today?
Do I know you?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you think would hold it off?
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
W...what?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
The War ain't over. 
Yeah...?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
...what happened...?
You can't tell this story.
I go with this here... 
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Shoes, Hats....
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
The hats.
With their berets...
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
Just want to take a nap.
...mmm.
Yup.
Oh, hell...
He's lying.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
What's going on?
Hey the door was open.
The stock's going to Pluto!
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
What if he asks where I got the money?
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
So, where are we going?
Okay.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
How do you know?
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
I guess I'll head back...
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
What the hell do you want?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Hello Bud.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
What if I have a previous engagement?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Weird and tiny huh?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Do you have a scarf?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I miss you.
What?
These are good.
What?
You think that'll help?
Are you humoring me?
Your friend saw them.
You think you influenced her?
No.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Toward the end.  You remember?
Who are you?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
What?  What are you afraid of?
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Your house is so beautiful.
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
They're calling me in to work.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
You should have heard her play.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She got it.  Turned it down.
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Someone's there.
Sit down here.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Okay.  Okay.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
I guess not.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
When's she out of here?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Whatcha reading?
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just us now.
Why?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Hi.
Did you call the police?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
You didn't?
Our house.
See?
When?
Tonight?
...like it never even happened...
I don't need a shrink.
How do you know this?
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
What?
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
It's too rough.
"You know..."
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
That's not what I'm sayi--
Claire, please don't...
Leave her out of this!
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
She did it.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Rowan...
My...mother...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
I'm serious.  You don't -
Seems more like a year than a month.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
She - she said I - I was a ---
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Hey - you're bleeding.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Is he - is he gonna die...?
When aid you get home last night...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
When could I look round?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
I lost the touch
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Sugar?
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Well, what do you think?
What?
I want you out now
It's been what, three years?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
Her husband left her
That's good
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
See? Did you see that?
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Get them together.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Well. The prom's coming up.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Sweetheart, what is it?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Sorry I--
You do know how to drive?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
If you could just sign right there.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Where are we going?
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
You're amazing.
That's probably my office.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Tell me more.
I see.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
But who would run the store?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I never figured you for a pimp.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Yes?
What are you doing?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
My parents? What do you mean?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How you doing, Artie?
How soon can we get something?
Merritt, Forensics.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
You okay?
Then what?
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You saw the news today?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Eliminate the competition.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
Yeah.
He did say something.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
She bit you?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
What?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Kelly...
How much?
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Come on, let loose!
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Get away from me.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
But she ran away.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
But I..
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
So... what happened?
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Can you fill me in here?
What is that?
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
My hat is off to you, sir.
My God!  He's so excessive!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Anyone?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
You're not that big.
I've even printed my own currency.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Easy now.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Thank you, friend.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are very important, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
I do what I'm told.
Who is that girl, anyway?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You all right?
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Where's the baby??
She's a bird, Willow.
I don't know, Willow.
Dada, what's a daikini?
You must learn magic.
What's the magician's weapon?
But what am I gonna transform??
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
She's hungry.
I'm getting her out of there!
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
Obviously.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Nail it!
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
What are you going to do?
Have you got your gun on now?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
It's all over, Paul.
What was that?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
It's me.
I'm coming.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
John said you're Amish.
Who was that man?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
What about Carter?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
No, you listen. Get out!
Momma... are they angry with us.
Aunt Em!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
No --
Dorothy!
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
To see?
From now on you'll be history
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Toto's my dog.
I thought you said she was dead.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Aw, come, come, come --
...her face is careworn.
...bed.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh --
Oh - I'll get it!
We might.
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
A home --
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...yes.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
...ting the ruby slippers?
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
Stop pushing!
You humbug!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Whozat?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Let's.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
...to Dorothy!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
Stop that dog!
-- Ruined my exit!
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
The King pipeline.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.
The name?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Who is he?
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I can’t stay.
What is it?
Then take me with you.
Vodka martini.
What the hell are you doing here?
How did you survive?
What are you talking about?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
So you killed your father.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Now...where were we?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Mother of God.
The Maiden’s Tower.
I’ll send someone out.
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
The parcel’s in the post.
What about our end?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
A whore fucking.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Hi, Jon.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
. . . What?
Laurie --
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
So do I.  So do you.
. . . That was quick.
What new information?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
How will you fix it?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
They tell me you're an American agent.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
What's that?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
Nothing. He had two days.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I think I'll hang on to these.
I can see that. Why?
What...?
Nice hops.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
That's the guy.
What's going on, my friend?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Including rape, pillage, murder.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Scott.. I -
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Where am I?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
That's a tough choice.
Well... we'll see.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Nineteen, sir.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
There wolf!  There castle!
What a filthy job!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Throw the third switch!
You'll be getting me sad next.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Yes, Master!
Hello there.
How's everything?
Get the sedative ready!
MMMmmmmmm.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Reputation.  Reputation!
I'd be so nervous.
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
His what??
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
